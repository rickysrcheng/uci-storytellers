cricket - leicestershire take over at top after innings victory . 


london 1996-08-30 


west indian all-rounder phil simmons took four for 38 on friday as leicestershire beat somerset by an innings and 39 runs in two days to take over at the head of the county championship . 


their stay on top , though , may be short-lived as title rivals essex , derbyshire and surrey all closed in on victory while kent made up for lost time in their rain-affected match against nottinghamshire . 


after bowling somerset out for 83 on the opening morning at grace road , leicestershire extended their first innings by 94 runs before being bowled out for 296 with england discard andy caddick taking three for 83 . 


trailing by 213 , somerset got a solid start to their second innings before simmons stepped in to bundle them out for 174 . 


essex , however , look certain to regain their top spot after nasser hussain and peter such gave them a firm grip on their match against yorkshire at headingley . 


hussain , considered surplus to england 's one-day requirements , struck 158 , his first championship century of the season , as essex reached 372 and took a first innings lead of 82 . 


by the close yorkshire had turned that into a 37-run advantage but off-spinner such had scuttled their hopes , taking four for 24 in 48 balls and leaving them hanging on 119 for five and praying for rain . 


at the oval , surrey captain chris lewis , another man dumped by england , continued to silence his critics as he followed his four for 45 on thursday with 80 not out on friday in the match against warwickshire . 


he was well backed by england hopeful mark butcher who made 70 as surrey closed on 429 for seven , a lead of 234 . 


derbyshire kept up the hunt for their first championship title since 1936 by reducing worcestershire to 133 for five in their second innings , still 100 runs away from avoiding an innings defeat . 


australian tom moody took six for 82 but chris adams , 123 , and tim o'gorman , 109 , took derbyshire to 471 and a first innings lead of 233 . 


after the frustration of seeing the opening day of their match badly affected by the weather , kent stepped up a gear to dismiss nottinghamshire for 214 . 


they were held up by a gritty 84 from paul johnson but ex-england fast bowler martin mccague took four for 55 . 


by stumps kent had reached 108 for three .

soccer - shearer named as england captain . 


london 1996-08-30 


the world 's costliest footballer alan shearer was named as the new england captain on friday . 


the 26-year-old , who joined newcastle for 15 million pounds sterling ( $ 23.4 million ) , takes over from tony adams , who led the side during the european championship in june , and former captain david platt . 


adams and platt are both injured and will miss england 's opening world cup qualifier against moldova on sunday . 


shearer takes the captaincy on a trial basis , but new coach glenn hoddle said he saw no reason why the former blackburn and southampton skipper should not make the post his own . 


" i 'm sure there wo n't be a problem , i 'm sure alan is the man for the job , " hoddle said . 


" there were three or four people who could have done it but when i spoke to alan he was up for it and really wanted it . 


" in four days it 's very difficult to come to a 100 percent conclusion about something like this ... 


but he knows how to conduct himself , his team mates respect him and he knows about the team situation even though he plays up front . " 


shearer 's euro 96 striking partner teddy sheringham withdrew from the squad with an injury on friday . 


he will probably be replaced by shearer 's newcastle team mate les ferdinand .

rotor volgograd must play their next home game behind closed doors after fans hurled bottles and stones at dynamo moscow players during a 1-0 home defeat on saturday that ended rotor 's brief spell as league leaders . 


the head of the russian league 's disciplinary committee , anatoly gorokhovsky , said on friday that rotor would play lada togliatti to empty stands on september 3 . 


the club , who put manchester united out of last year 's uefa cup , were fined $ 1,000 .

boxing - panama 's roberto duran fights the sands of time . 


panama city 1996-08-30 


panamanian boxing legend roberto " hands of stone " duran climbs into the ring on saturday in another age-defying attempt to sustain his long career . 


duran , 45 , takes on little-known mexican ariel cruz , 30 , in a super middleweight non-title bout in panama city . 


the fight , duran 's first on home soil for 10 years , is being billed here as the " return of the legend " and duran still talks as if he was in his prime . 


" i want a fifth title . 


this match is to prepare me . 


i feel good . 


i 'm not retiring , " duran told reuters . 


but those close to the boxer acknowledge that the man who has won championships in four different weight classes -- lightweight , welterweight , junior middleweight and middleweight -- is drawing close to the end of his career . 


" each time he fights , he 's on the last frontier of his career . 


if he loses saturday , it could devalue his position as one of the world 's great boxers , " panamanian boxing association president ramon manzanares said . 


duran , whose 97-12 record spans three decades , hopes a win in the 10-round bout will earn him a rematch against puerto rico 's hector " macho " camacho . 


camacho took a controversial points decision against the panamanian in atlantic city in june in a title fight .

tennis - tarango , o'brien spring twin upsets under the lights . 


larry fine 


new york 1996-08-30 


andre agassi escaped disaster on thursday but wimbledon finalist malivai washington and marcelo rios were not so fortunate on a night of upsets at the u.s. open . 


the 11th-seeded washington fell short of reprising his wimbledon miracle comeback as he lost to red-hot wildcard alex o'brien 6-3 6-4 5-7 3-6 6-3 in a two hour 51 minute struggle on the stadium court . 


next door on the grandstand , 10th seed rios lost to another player with a wimbledon connection -- bad boy jeff tarango . 


the temperamental left-hander defeated the chilean 6-4 4-6 7-6 6-2 . 


the day programme went smoothly although sixth-seeded former champion agassi had to wriggle out of a dangerous 3-6 0-4 hole , winning 18 of the last 19 games against india 's leander paes . 


but the night belonged to the upstarts . 


washington , who climbed back from a 1-5 deficit , two sets down in the third set against todd martin in the wimbledon semifinals , looked poised for another sensational comeback . 


o'brien , a winner two weeks ago in new haven for his first pro title , served for the match at 5-4 in the third set before washington came charging back . 


" i just kept saying to myself , ' keep giving yourself the best chance to win , keep battling , maybe something will happen , ' " said the 26-year-old o'brien , ranked 65th . 


" i kept my composure and i was proud of myself for that -- usually i would have folded up the tent and gone home . " 


the hard-serving o'brien , a former u.s. collegiate national champion , fired up 17 aces to ultimately subdue the never-say-die washington . 


the fifth set stayed on serve until the sixth game , when washington , after saving one break point with a forehand winner down the line , netted a backhand to give o'brien a 4-2 lead . 


the texan blasted in two aces to hold serve at 5-2 and then converted his eighth match point for victory when washington found the net with another backhand from 40-0 . 


" you just kind of keep fighting and you keep trying to make him play a little bit . 


i think he got a little tight at a couple of moments , " said washington . " 


but i think he served pretty well when he had to . " 


tarango , whose wimbledon tantrum two years ago brought him a $ 28,000 fine and suspension from this year 's tournament at the all-england club , argued calls and taunted fans in his lively two hour , 24 minute tango with rios on the grandstand . 


a boisterous cheering section backed the distracted chilean and booed the lanky american , who ate up all the attention . 


" i 'm an emotional player , " said the 104th-ranked tarango . " 


i think i played very well tonight , very focused . " 


the match turned on the third-set tiebreaker , which the american won 7-5 much to the dismay of the spectators . 


" i love the crowd if they boo me every day . 


it fires me up , makes me play my best tennis , " tarango said . 


" i played some of my best tennis in college when fraternities were throwing beer on me . 


if tennis was like that every day , i think everybody wold be having a lot more fun . " 


rios did not appreciate tarango 's antics . 


" he 's always complaining too much , " said rios . " 


but i think it 's not that . 


i think i played really bad . 


it was tough to play at night . 


balls were going really fast . 


i lost too many points that i never lose . 


i did n't play my tennis . " 


" i do n't see the ball like i see during the day . 


i play an american so that 's why i play at night . 


i did n't feel good on the court . " 


at the end of the match , tarango blew sarcastic kisses to the crowd , then jiggled his body to a rios rooting section in a jeering salute . 


" i support their enthusiasm , " tarango said about the fans . " 


at the same time , they 're cheering blatantly against me . 


after i won i figured i could give them a little razzle-dazzle . "

nfl american football-randall cunningham retires . 


philadelphia 1996-08-29 


randall cunningham , the national football league 's all-time leading rusher as a quarterback and one of the most athletic players ever to line up over centre , retired thursday . 


cunningham played his entire 11-year career with the philadelphia eagles . 


a three-time pro bowl selection , cunningham rushed for 4,482 yards on 677 carries . 


" i would like to thank the eagles organisation and the wonderful fans of philadelphia for supporting me throughout my career , " cunningham said . 


" although it saddens me to leave , i am looking forward to spending more time with my family and pursuing other interests that have been on the back burner for sometime . " 


" randall was one of the most exciting quarterbacks in nfl history , " said eagles owner jeffrey lurie . " 


during his 11 years in philadelphia , randall was the cornerstone of the eagles ' franchise and brought many great moments to fans in philadelphia as well as across the nfl . " 


a second-round choice in 1985 , cunningham completed 1,874-of-3,362 passes ( 55.7 percent ) for 22,877 yards and 150 touchdowns . 


cunningham has already been signed as a broadcaster .

golf - henke takes lead in milwaukee , woods makes pro debut . 


milwaukee , wisconsin 1996-08-29 


nolan henke fired a nine-under-par 62 to grab a two-shot lead after the opening round of the $ 1.2 million greater milwaukee open thursday as 20-year-old tiger woods shot 67 in his professional debut . 


henke stood two strokes ahead of bob estes and three up on billy andrade , duffy waldorf and jesper parnevik . 


woods , who turned pro tuesday after winning an unprecedented third successive u.s. amateur championship , almost eagled the 18th hole . 


he settled for a birdie and a four-under opening round that left him five shots off the pace . 


" yesterday was the toughest day i 've had for a long time , " woods said . " 


today , i got to play golf . " 


he added : " i thought i got off off to a great start . 


it was a perfect start . 


i 'm in a good position . " 


henke , who called his round a " pleasant surprise , " finished with six birdies on the final eight holes . 


" we finally got things going in the right direction , " he said . " 


it was my best round in a very long time . 


my short game has improved since i 've had to use it so often . 


that 's always been the worst part of my game . 


all in all , playing bad 's been a good experience . " 


henke , who came within one shot of the course record set by andrew magee during wednesday 's pro-am , has three career pga tour victories , but none since the 1993 bellsouth classic . 


estes , whose only win came at the 1994 texas open and whose best finish this year was a third-place tie at the nortel open in january , eagled the par-five fourth hole and added five birdies to grab sole possession of second place . 


" no bogeys on the card , " he noted . " 


sometimes i take more pride in that . " 


woods was among a group of 13 players at four under , including 1993 champion billy mayfair , who tied for second at last week 's world series of golf , and former u.s. open champ payne stewart . 


defending champion scott hoch shot a three-under 68 and was six strokes back . 


phil mickelson , the only four-time winner on the pga tour , skipped the tournament after winning the world series of golf last week . 


mark brooks , tom lehman and mark o'meara , who make up the rest of the top four on the money list , also took the week off .

athletics - mitchell defeats bailey in front of former champions .

berlin 1996-08-30 


american dennis mitchell outclassed olympic 100 metres champion donovan bailey for the third time at a major post-games meeting in front of the most experienced sprinting crowd in the world on friday . 


watched by an array of former olympic sprint champions at the berlin grand prix meeting , mitchell made a brilliant start in the 100 metres and held off bailey 's strong finish to win in 10.08 seconds despite cool conditions . 


bailey , who set a world record of 9.84 on his way to victory in atlanta , could not catch his american rival and had to settle for third in a tight finish . 


jamaica 's michael green was second with 10.09 with bailey finishing in 10.13 . 


last friday mitchell , who finished fourth at the atlanta games , upstaged a trio of olympic champions including bailey to win the 100 in brussels . 


earlier this month he also beat world champion bailey in zurich . 


berlin , brussels and zurich all belong to the most lucrative series in the sport , the golden four . 


among the crowd on friday were olympic 100 metres champions going back to 1948 . 


they had been invited to the meeting to watch a special relay to mark the 60th anniversary of jesse owens 's four gold medals at the 1936 olympics in the same berlin stadium . 


" today the concentration was the most important thing for me , " mitchell said . 


despite the coolish conditions american olympic champion gail devers looked in commanding form in the women 's 100 , clocking 10.89 to defeat jamaican rival merlene ottey , who was second in 10.94 .

soccer - three standard liege players banned , club fined . 


geneva 1996-08-30 


uefa came down heavily on belgian club standard liege on friday for " disgraceful behaviour " in an intertoto final match against karlsruhe of germany . 


the belgian club were fined 25,000 swiss francs ( $ 20,850 ) for unsporting conduct and captain guy hellers banned for seven games . 


he was sent off for insulting the referee and then urged his team mates to protest . 


roberto bisconti will be sidelined for six euro ties after pushing the referee in the back as he protested about a karlsruhe goal , while didier ernst was banned for four matches for a verbal attack soon after bisconti was also dismissed . 


karlsruhe won the august 20 match 3-1 thanks to two late goals . 


they took the tie 3-2 on aggregate and qualified for the uefa cup .

athletics - harrison , edwards to meet in sarajevo . 


monte carlo 1996-08-30 


olympic champion kenny harrison and world record holder jonathan edwards will both take part in a triple jump competition at the solidarity meeting for sarajevo on september 9 . 


the international amateur athletic federation said on friday that a schedule reshuffle had allowed organisers to hold a men 's triple jump as well as the women 's long jump on the " one usable runway at the war-devastated " kosevo stadium . 


atlanta games silver medal winner edwards has called on other leading athletes to take part in the sarajevo meeting -- a goodwill gesture towards bosnia as it recovers from the war in the balkans -- two days after the grand prix final in milan . 


edwards was quoted as saying : " what type of character do we show by going to the iaaf grand prix final in milan where there is a lot of money to make but refusing to make the trip to sarajevo as a humanitarian gesture ? "

soccer - milan 's lentini moves to atalanta . 


milan 1996-08-30 


former italian international winger gianluigi lentini , transferred to milan in 1992 for what was believed to be a world record sum , has been loaned to serie a club atalanta for a year , newspapers reported on friday . 


the gazzetta dello sport said the deal would cost atalanta around $ 600,000 . 


lentini , 27 , joined milan from torino in a $ 12 million deal that many have speculated involved far more money changing hands and which has subsequently been investigated by magistrates for alleged financial irregularities . 


the player suffered severe head injuries in a near-fatal car crash the following year and has since struggled to regain the form that made him a hero in turin . 


the move to bergamo-based atalanta reunites lentini , who fell out with ex-milan coach fabio capello last season , with his former coach at torino , emiliano mondonico .

romania comelf h1 profit rise below target . 


bucharest 1996-08-30 


romanian listed state engineer comelf said it almost doubled six-month output , with net profit rising by 33 percent to 1.069 billion lei . 


but the company complained inflation and the artificially high rate of the leu cut profit margins on exports , keeping profits well below its forecast of 1.4 billion lei . 


comelf 's six-month output rose to 4,378 tonnes of equipment from 2,684 tonnes in the equivalent period in 1995 , the company report to the bucharest stock exchange showed . 


comelf , based in the central transylvanian town of bistrita , manufactures water purification equipment , machinery for the thermal power sector and other equipment . 


" in the first six months of 1996 we concentrated on increasing the volume of our output and exports in particular and improving the quality of our products , " the report said . 


from january to june comelf exported 59 percent of its output , up from 37.3 percent in the same period last year . 


the company said higher than anticipated inflation and rising raw materials and wage costs also hit profits . 


year-on-year inflation , initially estimated at 20 percent in december , was 33.8 percent in june , higher than a revised end-year forecast of 30 percent . 


the 12 month figure quickened to 40.3 percent in july . 


the leu currency has slipped only gradually this year , and is currently quoted at an official rate of 3,162 to the dollar , well below the 3,550 retail price that exporters say is more realistic .

u.s. debt futures end lower , shaken by chicago napm . 


chicago 1996-08-30 


u.s. debt futures finished a shortened pre-holiday session sharply lower , as the markets were shaken by a stronger than expected rise in the august national association of purchasing management ( napm ) index for the chicago area , traders and analysts said . 


the august chicago napm rose 8.8 points to 60.0 , its highest level since 62.6 in february 1995 and the largest monthly rise since december 1993 . 


primary dealers immediately sold eurodollar and bond futures , after the market on average was expecting the index to rise marginally to 51.9 from july 's 51.2 . 


traders also said japanese investors were unwinding long eurodollar futures / short swaps , and that heavy put buying helped pressure eurodollars to lower levels before the close . 


one u.s. firm bought 35,000 september 97 mid-curve put options at a strike price of 93.25 to 93.30 in the last two sessions , while a french firm bought 4,000 september 93.30 to 93.32 put spreads . 


" even before the data came out , we were seeing put buying , " one floor trader said . 


meanwhile , funds were reportedly good sellers of five-year notes . 


rumors circulated that the federal reserve was buying five-year notes , and that a renowned hedge fund manager was buying 10-year notes in the cash markets . 


however , december t-bonds ended below a major trendline level at 106-26/32 , as the yield in the cash bond market set its highest monthly close since april 1995 at 7.12 percent , one analyst said . 


december bonds blew through the july 30 low of 107-06/32 , even though conditions were slightly oversold , traders said . 


the december calendar spread continued to widen , also reflecting the market 's fear of rising inflation . 


while the market continues to price-in higher u.s. interest rates , there was little conviction to the theory that the federal reserve would tighten rates before the next federal open market committee meeting on september 24 . 


federal reserve governor lawrence lindsey , speaking on u.s. cable television network cnbc , said the u.s. economy appears on balance to be a bit strong , adding the central bank would not curb growth provided inflation remains in check . 


earlier in the day , fed chairman alan greenspan said at the annual jackson hole symposium that the goal of price stability is within reach for major nations . 


traders said the fed 's decision to adopt a tightening bias at the july fomc meeting has cast more focus on every piece of u.s. economic news .

douglas & lomason shares rise on merger . 


farmington hills , mich . 


1996-08-30 


shares of douglas & lomason co were up 4-1/2 at 30-5/8 friday afternoon after thursday 's announcement that the vehicle seat maker had agreed to be acquired by magna international inc for $ 31 a share , or $ 135 million . 


magna was up 1/8 to 48-1/4 on the new york stock exchange . 


douglas & lomason has 4.45 million common shares outstanding , some of which are option shares to be purchased at exercise prices less than the $ 31 offered price . 


the acquisition will beef up markham , ontario-based magna 's north american car and truck seating business , allowing it to better compete with johnson controls inc and lear corp . 


family-controlled douglas & lomason , which had 1995 revenue of $ 561 million , was finding it more difficult to compete for new seating contracts from vehicle makers , said james hoey , chief financial officer . 


" unfortunately , in the auto industry these days , a $ 500 million company is not a big company anymore , " hoey said . " 


this merger makes us much more competitive . " 


he added that douglas & lomason 's top executives have been asked to stay on with magna after the merger , though their future roles have not yet been defined . 


douglas & lomason 's profits were hurt in the past year by model changeovers , which had reduced production at some important customers , but are now recovering , analysts said . 


the company earned $ 11.2 million on sales of $ 299 million in the first six months of 1996 , up from year-earlier earnings of $ 4.7 million on sales of $ 285.7 million . 


ford plans to cut its roster of 2,300 tier-one suppliers -- those it deals with directly -- in half over the next five years . 


" the deal really levels the seating field somewhat , " said john casesa of schroder wertheim & co . " 


it should give magna the critical mass to be a bigger player in that market . " 


magna 's traditional strength has been instrument panels , door panels and other interior components . 


magna , johnson controls and lear have been working to build up their capabilties to supply complete interiors to automakers , including seats , instrument panels , door panels carpeting and headliners .

iraqi captors of sudanese jet charged with hijack . 


london 1996-08-30 


seven iraqis who seized a sudanese airliner with 199 people aboard and forced it to fly to london were on friday charged with hijack , ending speculation that they might be offered immediate asylum in britain . 


police said the seven men , who freed all their hostages after the plane landed at stansted airport on tuesday and then appealed for asylum , would appear in court on saturday . 


the iraqis claimed they were " ordinary people persecuted by the regime of saddam ( hussein ) " but interior ministry officials had consistently said it was likely the seven would be charged with hijack before any plea for asylum was considered . 


under english law the maximum sentence for hijack is life imprisonment , but there has been widespread speculation that the seven will receive lesser sentences and then be allowed to stay rather than being sent back to iraq . 


the hijack began on monday when an amman-bound plane was taken over shortly after it took off from khartoum . 


the hijackers threatened to blow it up during a refuelling stop in cyprus unless they were taken to london . 


after a search of the aircraft following the hijackers ' surrender , police found only knives and fake explosives .

london 1996-08-30 


former world heavyweight champion frank bruno has quit the ring on medical advice , britain 's sun newspaper reported on friday . 


an eye specialist told the 35-year-old bruno that he could be blinded in one eye if he boxed again , the newspaper said . 


the briton , who lost his world boxing council ( wbc ) title to mike tyson in march , said : " i was in shock as soon as he told me and it still has n't really sunk in . 


" i never wanted to end like this but at the end of the day i 'm glad i had a good innings . " 


bruno , for years one of britain 's most popular sportsmen , had hoped to have another shot at the world title and had been in training until a routine eye test on monday highlighted a problem with his right eye . 


professor david mcleod , who examined bruno , told the sun : " there is a risk he could be blinded in the eye if he steps into the ring again . 


he is in danger of getting a retinal detachment and there is no point in exposing himself to that . "

but bruno lost the title on his first defence when he fought american tyson in las vegas .

yeltsin endorses lebed chechnya peace plan - agency . 


moscow 1996-08-30 


russian prime minister viktor chernomyrdin said on friday that president boris yeltsin , who is vacationing outside moscow , had backed security chief alexander lebed 's peace plan for chechnya , interfax news agency said . 


" lebed is now in chechnya solving some problems , " interfax quoted chernomyrdin as saying . " 


the main thing is his programme . 


it was agreed with boris nikolayevich ( yeltsin ) yesterday . " 


lebed , whom yeltsin ordered to restore peace in chechnya , struck a military deal with separatist rebels last week ending the worst fighting in the region in more than a year . 


he later discussed with rebel chief-of-staff aslan maskhadov a framework political agreement to tackle the most painful issue of the 20-month war -- the future political status of chechnya . 


lebed said on friday he hoped to sign a document with the rebels later in the day which would deal with the political settlement of the conflict . 


moscow , which wants to keep chechnya as a part of the russian federation , sent troops to the region in december 1994 to quell its independence bid . 


yeltsin has said any deal should preserve russia 's territorial integrity . 


itar-tass news agency quoted lebed as saying that he would suggest to the rebels that the decision on chechnya 's future political status be deferred by up to 10 years . 


lebed said he had a telephone conversation with yeltsin late on thursday but gave no details . 


yeltsin 's press office could not confirm the call . 


chernomyrdin said on thursday after a meeting with lebed and top officials , who discussed lebed 's plans to restore peace in chechnya , that it needed more work .

russian peacemaker alexander lebed said he and rebel military leader aslan maskhadov agreed after overnight talks to defer the decision on whether chechnya should be independent until december 31 , 2001 . 


" we just now signed a statement and attached the basic principles of relations between the russian federation and the chechen republic , " lebed told reporters after he and maskhadov signed a package of documents . 


he gave no further details . 


" that 's it , the war is over , " lebed told reporters who witnessed the signing . 


lebed said he and maskhadov agreed to defer by more than five years the painful issue of chechnya 's political status . 


" then , with cool heads , calmly and soberly we will sort out our relations , " lebed said after the late-night signing ceremony in this settlement outside chechnya 's eastern border . 


tens of thousands of people have died in the war , begun in late 1994 after moscow sent troops to quell chechnya 's independence bid . 


but russia failed to win control over the whole of chechnya and its troops suffered several humiliating defeats . 


president boris yeltsin ordered lebed to restore peace in chechnya and gave him unspecified sweeping powers to carry out the mission . 


prime minister viktor chernomyrdin said on friday that yeltsin backed a package of proposals lebed took to the talks .

ruling moslem party ends vote boycott . 


sarajevo 1996-08-30 


bosnia 's ruling moslem nationalist party on friday called on its refugee voters to end a boycott of absentee balloting in national elections , citing assurances provided by a u.s. envoy , government radio said . 


the bosnian government radio broadcast said u.s. assistant secretary of state john kornblum had reassured sda officials , including presumably its leader , bosnian president alija izetbegovic , whom he met during a friday visit . 


but the radio report did not specify what guarantees , if any , the u.s. envoy had provided . 


absentee voting in the elections began on wednesday , august 28 and runs for a week . 


election day for those living inside bosnia is september 14 . 


the party of democratic action ( sda ) had called on wednesday for its followers abroad to boycott the absentee balloting because of voter registration irregularities , especially among serb refugees . 


the organisation for security and cooperation in europe ( osce ) postponed municipal elections as a result of the irregularities but decided to proceed with voting for higher offices . 


the sda , joined by two other parties , has been demanding that osce prohibit refugees voting from any place other than their pre-war place of residence as a means to prevent the elections from ratifying the results of ethnic cleansing .

top belarus politician blasts president . 


larisa sayenko 


minsk 1996-08-30 


a senior belarus politician accused president alexander lukashenko on friday of attempting to set up a dictatorship in the former soviet republic . 


the speaker of the belarus parliament , semyon sharetsky , told reuters that a draft constitution , due to be put to a national referendum on november 7 , would dangerously increase the powers of the ruler . 


" the world community should not be indifferent to the fact that president lukashenko , who leads this european state of 10 million people , is trying to establish a dictatorship with his new constitution , " sharetsky said . 


the new constitution calls for a two-chamber parliament with a 110-seat majority-elected house of representatives and a regionally-represented senate with a third of its members named by the president . 


lukashenko 's aides shrugged off sharetsky 's charge . " 


if there was a dictatorship they would n't have the right to say things like this , " sergei posukhov , lukashenko 's political adviser , told reuters . 


" the people have asked us to establish order and that 's our main aim . " 


lukashenko , 41 , won presidential polls in 1994 on promises to restore order , fight corruption and repair the strong links with russia that were disrupted by the collapse of the soviet union . 


but during his period in office he has battled against nationalist opponents , trade unions and parliament and sharetsky said the current parliament was ready to try to impeach him . 


" this constitution , which has been prepared in secret , aims to gather all power in one man 's hands , " he said . " 


we should not be fooled by his quasi-democratic rhetoric and his methods , like this referendum . " 


lukashenko signed a pact with moscow in april to create a strong economic and political union which he believes could grow into a federation . 


but nationalist groups , scared by the prospect of renewed moscow domination and russia 's backing for lukashenko , protested against the deal . 


lukashenko responded by cracking down on the nationalist opposition and jailing nearly 200 people for taking part in demonstrations against the pact . 


the united states last week granted political asylum to two opposition leaders , zenon poznyak and sergei naumchik .

tavildara , tajikistan 1996-08-30 


tajik government troops now control of the strategically vital town of tavildara after driving out islamic rebels , but sporadic gunfire still echoed in the nearby pamir mountains on friday . 


the commander-in-chief of tajikistan 's armed forces , major-general nikolai sherbatov , took a group of journalists by helicopter to the remote , and now devastated , town to show that his forces held it . 


he said his troops took tavildara without casualties on august 23 , but the crack of sniper and machinegun fire revealed the presence of opposition fighters in the surrounding mountains . 


sherbatov said the rebels were located about three km ( two miles ) east of tavildara around the village of layron . 


tavildara , 200 km ( 120 miles ) east of the capital dushanbe , was in ruins . 


shells had smashed roofs and windows and empty shell cases littered the streets . 


the town straddles a strategically important road linking government and rebel-held territory and has fallen succesively to both sides in a bloody tug-of-war which began last february . 


tajikistan , which borders afghanistan and china , has been split by a dragging four-year conflict after a civil war between communists and a frail coalition of islamic and liberal groups . 


tens of thousands of people have been killed and many more have been displaced in the fighting , which breached a shaky united nations-sponsored ceasefire . 


tavildara is now apparently inhabited only by a few old men , women and their grubby , barefoot children . 


fruit remained on the trees as there was no one to pick it . 


" help me , help me , " said a chorus of women begging soldiers for food . 


the town 's school and a shop doubling as a warehouse for humanitarian aid were destroyed in the fighting . 


" we had to build our own earth shelters to survive the fighting , " said rajab adinayev , a bearded elderly tajik in a long white shirt . 


although shy in front of the government soldiers , several inhabitants accused government forces of widespread looting of homes and livestock . 


they also said rebel fighters had looted medicines from the local hospital . 


one elderly man , who declined to give his name , said two of his sons were now refugees in moscow and the other two had left to fight for the opposition . 


he also said government soldiers had raped the wife of one of his sons . "

shares of france-registered printed packaging company cofinec s.a. plunged sharply on the budapest stock exchange ( bse ) on friday , despite a mostly reassuring forecast by the group . 


cofinec 's global depositary receipts ( gdrs ) opened at 5,200 forints on the bse , down 600 from thursday 's close , following the release of its first half results this morning . 


cofinec ceo stephen frater told reporters in a conference call from vienna on friday before the opening of the bourse that he expects a stronger second half , although the group will not be able to achieve its annual profit goal . 


" we will not achieve the full 37 million french franc ( net ) profit forecast , " frater said . " 


obviously , we cannot make up the unexpected decrease that has been experienced in the first half of the year . " 


frater declined to give a forecast for the full year , ahead of a supervisory board meeting next week . 


cofinec , the first foreign company to list on the budapest bourse , released its consolidated first half figures ( ias ) this morning . 


in the conference call , frater said he regarded cofinec gdrs -- which are trading below their issue price of 6,425 forints -- as a buying opportunity . 


" obviously , at some point it represents a buying opportunity , " frater said . " 


i think the reality is that we operate in emerging markets , emerging markets tend to be more volatile . " 


" my message is that the fundamental strategy of the company , its fundamental market position has not changed . " 


the group , which operates in hungary , poland and the czech republic , reported an operating profit before interest of 21.8 million french francs compared to 34.1 million in the same six months of 1995 . 


net profit for the january-june 1996 period was 2.1 million french francs , down from 10.3 million in the first six months of 1995 , with the bulk of this decline attributable to the performance of petofi , one of its hungarian units . 


cofinec said petofi general manager laszlo sebesvari had submitted his resignation and will be leaving petofi but will remain on petofi 's board of directors . 


" until a new general manager of petofi is appointed ... 


i will in fact move to kecskemet ( site of petofi printing house ) for the interim and will serve as acting chief executive officer of petofi , " frater said .

the editor was prosecuted following a may 1995 article alleging top-level corruption . 


sihanouk promised an amnesty to hen vipheak , along with fellow knp member and journalist chan rattana , who was released after serving a week of a year-long jail term in june . 


co-premiers prince norodom ranariddh and hun sen agreed earlier this week to the king 's request for an amnesty .

far east gold - moribund market seen continuing . 


mishi saran 


hong kong 1996-08-30 


far east gold traders thumped foreheads in frustration at the market 's foot-dragging this week and forecast on friday that next week would not be much better . 


the southeast asian gold market was more or less a photo-fit picture of the previous week 's position with activity slow and bullion prices trapped in a well-worn range awaiting a seasonal upturn in demand and prices into the fourth quarter . 


singapore premiums for australian kilo bars were quoted unchanged at between 25-45 cents an ounce over spot loco london prices , with south korean and indonesian-origin premiums also steady at 10-20 cents an ounce . 


singapore dealers said they were concerned that there had been a marked revival in offers to sell gold by south korean traders , following the distress sales of recent months after the seoul government 's crackdown on bullion arbitrage trade . 


" i was shocked to see these offers coming in again , though there 's been no indication of price or volume . 


i dread to think what will happen to the premiums if the koreans start selling in force , " one dealer said . 


continued dishoarding of kilo-bars by indonesian sources ahead of next year 's presidential election has also kept a lid on premiums . 


gold closed down at $ 387.00 / $ 387.50 an ounce in hong kong on friday , versus new york 's $ 387.60 / $ 388 finish on thursday . 


dealers said the precious metal eased on a report that the international monetary fund might sell some of its gold to reduce the debts of the poorest developing countries . 


easier silver prices mid-week helped keep spot gold locked in a $ 386 - $ 389 an ounce range , dealers said , but they remained optimistic that the usual seasonal pick-up in jewellery fabrication demand would see gold at $ 395 by end-october . 


" i still think we 'll see gold at $ 395 by the end of october , in a retracement of the $ 418 - $ 380 move we saw at the start of the year , " one said . 


silver , basis the september contract on new york 's comex market , was expected to find support at between $ 5.12 - $ 5.15 an ounce and meet resistance from $ 5.25 - $ 5.30 , they added . 


september silver closed up $ 0.004 in new york on thursday at $ 5.255 an ounce .

tripoli decks out for coup celebrations . 


mona eltahawy 


tripoli 1996-08-30 


libyans are dressing up their capital tripoli for celebrations on sunday of the 27th anniversary of the coup which brought muammar gaddafi to power . 


green flags and banners praise the " great revolution " and promise defiance against united nations sanctions imposed for libya 's refusal to hand over for trial two suspects wanted in connection with the 1988 bombing of a pan am flight over lockerbie , scotland . 


" we have chosen the challenge because it is our only option , " proclaimed one banner on the road to tripoli airport which serves only internal flights because of the sanctions . 


huge stadium lights are directed at the city 's green square where makeshift stages await sunday 's festivities . 


three african leaders -- from niger , guinea and ghana -- are expected to attend the celebrations marking september 1 , 1969 when a group of young army officers , led by a 27-year-old gaddafi , deposed king mohammed idris . 


" the revolution has brought us great achievements ... 


we are comfortable the revolution has taken care of us , improved our lives and given us capabilites , " samer ammar soliman , 42 , told reuters as he came out of friday prayers . 


but some libyans have begun to show their discontent in the country 's east , which has become a hotbed of militant violence . 


tripoli-based diplomats and exiled opponents said gaddafi 's airforce blasted in july rebel strongholds in the mountainous jebel al-akhdar region . 


travellers arriving in egypt say militants and police officers clash regularly in benghazi . 


at least 20 people were killed in the capital in early july after bodyguards loyal to gaddafi 's sons fired at spectators of a football match who were chanting subversive slogans . 


gaddafi has dismissed any unrest as the work of foreigners , and last year deported thousands of sudanese and egyptian workers .

twilight zone for wall street as political race heats up . 


pierre belec 


new york 1996-08-30 


for wall street , this is the season to be cautious as the presidential contest puts the stock market in the twilight zone . 


president clinton , bob dole and ross perot are hitting the road now that the partying is over , and people who have billions of dollars invested in stocks were bracing for political promises that could have an impact on their wealth . 


analysts believe that the candidates will add to the market 's list of uncertainties , which already includes the question of whether the federal reserve will raise interest rates to cool economic growth . 


they say the politicians will need to promote legislation that helps the economy without scaring the socks off financial markets . 


" the worst thing that could happen for financial markets is that if clinton and dole start to trade shots in the middle of the ring with one-upmanship , " said hugh johnson , chief investment officer at first albany corp. " that 's when wall street will need to worry . " 


he said that the bond market would be the first to react if the " bidding " intensifies and stocks would quickly drop as interest rates rise . 


" i do n't think it would imply the collapse of the stock market , unless the rise in rates touches off a dynamic within the market , which would include selling by portfolio managers , redemptions by individuals of mutual funds that would , in turn , pressure the portfolio managers to sell even more stock . " 


this week , the market weighed dole 's proposal to lower federal income taxes by 15 percent across the board , a package that carries a price tag of $ 548 billion . 


clinton proposes an $ 8.4 billion re-election agenda that would spare most home-sellers from capital gains taxes and give employers tax incentives to hire people off the welfare rolls . 


clinton claims dole 's plan would increase the deficit , while the white house said some corporate taxes would be raised to offset the cost of the president 's plan . 


the experts said there are some unusual risks for the market from this year 's political season because the rush to promise tax cuts to win votes could upset wall street 's expectations that washington will balance the budget . 


" the stock market will have to edit the promises and then do a probability study on those edited promises , " said john geraghty at the consulting firm north american equity services . 


during the past four presidential elections , the candidate that has favoured tax cuts has won . 


ronald reagan 's tax cut won him a second four-year term in the white house in 1984 , while democrat walter mondale , who promised higher taxes , lost . 


george bush became president in 1988 on his no-new-tax campaign and clinton won in 1992 with a promise to fatten workers ' paychecks . 


the trick , they said , will be for the candidates to continue to convince wall street that the treasury 's 30-year bond -- the most closely-watched interest rate -- will fall to between 4 percent and 5 percent by the end of the decade . 


johnson said that long-term interest rates have already been spooked by the election . 


the long-term bond jumped this week to 7.13 percent after starting the year at 5.95 percent . 


the surge of buying in stocks during the last two years has come amid an environment of low interest rates , which has boosted corporate profits . 


but the market stalled this summer after the dow jones industrial average set a record high of 5,778.00 points on may 22 . 


" the market does n't seem to be able to make new highs and it has been back and forth in a fairly horizontal mode which looks like a holding pattern , " said geraghty . 


he said the market reflects the political uncertainty , now that dole has sharply narrowed the gap with clinton in the polls . 


geraghty said that the one thing that could completely turn the election around are new findings in the whitewater scandal that would damage the clintons . 


" stocks are on a delicate edge because if something happens that looks like it could upset the presidency , it could throw the political and , to some extent the economic , process into chaos , " geraghty said . 


right now , wall street is pondering the candidates . 


" we have an election where there are so many unknown variables that most people will probably want to hold fire , and even take the chance that they will have to pay higher prices for stocks after the november election , than take the risk that a shock to the system will hurt the stock market , " geraghty said . 


on friday , the dow jones index closed down 31.44 points at 5,616.21 . 


for the week , it was down 106.53 points . 


the nasdaq composite index closed 3.53 points lower friday at 1,141.50 . 


for the week , it was down 1.55 points . 


the standard & poor 's index of 500 stocks was off 5.41 points at 651.99 , down 15.03 points for the week . 


the american stock exchange index was down 1.66 points at 559.68 , and was off 1.26 for the week .

brisk economic reports rattle markets anew . 


glenn somerville 


washington 1996-08-30 


factory orders rose in july and manufacturing surged in the midwest in august , reports said friday , sparking worries about inflation that battered financial markets for a second straight day . 


the commerce department said orders for manufactured goods climbed 1.8 percent in july to a seasonally adjusted $ 317.6 billion -- nearly twice the increase that had been expected . 


shipments of everything from new cars to food items rose , as did order backlogs , in a sign that the strength in the industrial sector would continue in coming months . 


a separate report from chicago area purchasing managers underlined the strength in manufacturing as the group 's barometer of manufacturing in the region jumped to 60 in august from 51.2 in july . 


a reading above 50 indicates growth in manufacturing . 


while production and orders rose at midwest area businesses , the prices they paid for goods used in manufacturing remained well in check . 


analysts said the reports implied the economy was not slowing down in the third quarter after a burst of growth in the spring , and that the lull in late june and july was more temporary than federal reserve policy-makers had wanted . 


" it appears that august is showing an economy again reversing course and is not moving onto a significantly slower track at this point , " said economist lynn reaser of barnett banks inc. in jacksonville , fla . 


the reports fanned worries on wall street that the fed , the nation 's central bank , would raise rates next month in a bid to ward off inflation , driving stock and bond prices sharply lower for a second day running . 


the 30-year treasury fell almost a point , raising its yield , which moves in the opposite direction from the price , to 7.12 percent from 7.04 percent late thursday . 


the dow jones industrial average fell 31.44 points to 5,616.21 after a 64.73-point decline thursday . 


a third report from the commerce department , on july personal income and spending , pointed to a potential slowdown in consumer spending that some analysts said may help moderate growth in the second half . 


it showed spending rose only 0.2 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 5.15 trillion after dropping a revised 0.4 percent in june . 


incomes from wages , salaries and all other sources gained 0.1 percent to a rate of $ 6.47 trillion after a 0.9 percent jump in june . 


july 's slight gain in incomes was the weakest in six months , since january when they were flat . 


economist joel naroff of first union bank in philadelphia said consumer spending , which fuels two-thirds of the nation 's economy , may be much slower in the third quarter than in the first half , which should slow economic growth . 


" the fomc ( federal open market committee ) has been forecasting a slowing in economic activity and moderating household demand will have a large impact on overall economic growth , " naroff said in a written comment . 


the policy-making fomc is to meet on sept . 


24 to plot interest-rate strategy . 


it already has adopted a bias toward raising rates to keep a lid on wage and price rises and help sustain the 5-1 / 2-year-old economic expansion . 


in an interview on the cable television network cnbc friday , federal reserve governor lawrence lindsey said there still were " mixed signals " about the economy 's direction . 


" i think that , on balance , it is looking a little bit on the strong side , " lindsey said . 


he added that with expansion as solid as it is and with unemployment so low " the greater risks are clearly that we might see some overheating . " 


while july consumer spending rose only slightly , there were ample indications that consumers remained confident . 


the university of michigan 's august index of consumer sentiment , made available on friday to paying subscribers , rose to 95.3 from 94.7 in july . 


reaser said strong consumer confidence coupled with relatively lean inventories were providing manufacturers with a reason to gear up production . 


" the economy is not going to be expanding at the 4.8 percent ( annual ) rate that we had in the second quarter but it is likely to keep expanding in the 3 percent range , " she said , above the 2 percent to 2-1/4 percent that the fed considers to be non-inflationary . 


new orders to factories were strong for durable goods like new cars and for nondurables like paper and food products . 


orders for durable goods , meant to last three years or more , rose a revised 1.7 percent in july after falling 0.2 percent in june . 


orders for nondurables jumped 1.8 percent following a 1.2 percent decrease in june .

mexican avocados not expected in u.s . 


maggie mcneil 


washington 1996-08-30 


u.s. agriculture department officials said friday that mexican avocados -- which are restricted from entering the continental united states -- will not likely be entering u.s. markets any time soon , even if the controversial ban were lifted today . 


" the opportunity to import ( mexican avocados ) probably wo n't become possible for another year , " said paul drazek , senior trade advisor to agriculture secretary dan glickman . 


" we could lift the ban tomorrow , but that would not mean anything immediately , " said drazek . " 


we probably would not see avacados come in until next season , next november . " 


the agriculture department proposed more than a year ago to significantly ease an 82-year ban on mexican avocados . 


under the administration 's proposal , the borders to the mexican produce would be opened into 19 northern and northeastern states from november through february . 


the plan has raised a storm of protest from u.s. avocado growers , who are largely concentrated in california . 


california growers have charged that removing the restrictions , even on a limited basis , would endanger the $ 1 billion u.s. industry if potentially harmful mexican insects were brought into the country along with the avocados . 


mexican officials contend that there is no scientific basis for the ban , and that it is illegal under international trading rules of the world trade organisation . 


proponents of the plan discount the worries of the u.s. growers and say the plan has enough safeguards built into it to eliminate any significant threat to american producers . 


under the proposal , only imports of export-quality avocados growing in approved orchards in michoacan , mexico , the country 's main avocado area , would be allowed . 


mexican growers and distributors would have to abide by strict rules established by the mexican and u.s. agriculture agencies . 


the california avocado commission -- which has spearheaded the opposition to lifting the ban -- said new data the group submitted to the agriculture department last spring shows the department underestimated the pest problem in mexico and have urged that the agency reopen its study of the issue . 


the administration is still studying the new data , and officials have said that if experts think the information is significant , the agency could reopen its investigation . 


but u.s. avocado industry sources said that while they may have delayed the plan for a while , they ultimately do not expect the administration to change its position . 


" from a common-sense view , the department should reconsider this plan , but due to politics they will probably go ahead with this , " said tom bellamore of the california avocado group . 


administration officials said they want to get the issue resolved as quickly as possible , but said there is no timetable they are working under . 


" it 's a very complicated issue , " said the agriculture department 's drazek . " 


we 'll get it resolved as quickly as we can , based on the best available science . "

u.s. cardinal bernardin says has terminal cancer . 


chicago 1996-08-30 


chicago cardinal joseph bernardin , head of the second-largest u.s. roman catholic archdiocese , said on friday his doctors had diagnosed him as having liver cancer and he had a year or less to live . 


bernardin , 68 , underwent extensive surgery for pancreatic cancer in june 1995 followed by months of chemotherapy , which he said made him more aware of his own vulnerabilities and the need to minister to the sick . 


" on wednesday , examinations indicated that the cancer has returned , this time in the liver . 


i am told that it is terminal and that my life expectancy is one year or less , " a composed bernardin told a news conference . 


in 14 years as chicago 's archbishop , he built a prayerful , saintly image and was deeply involved in world church issues and publicly committed to rooting out abuses by clergy . 


" i have been assured that i still have some quality time left , " he said , saying he would undergo a new form of chemotherapy but his doctors have told him there was only a slim chance of a cure and the liver cancer was inoperable . 


" it 's not going to be easy to say goodbye to everybody . 


death does have some sad dimensions to it but i am a man of faith , " he said . " 


death is a natural phenomenom . " 


he said he would " serve until the end " as cardinal . 


pancreatic cancer is among the most deadly forms of the disease , although bernardin 's case was caught early . 


surgeons removed a cancerous kidney , parts of his pancreas and stomach , small intestine , bile duct and surrounding tissues . 


he made a rapid recovery and resumed most of his duties , but then developed a deteriorating condition in his spine that caused him great pain and shortened his height by several inches . 


he was scheduled to undergo back surgery next month , but that was cancelled when the cancer was discovered in his liver in order to avoid delaying the start of chemotherapy . 


the spare , soft-spoken son of an italian stonecutter took over the chicago archdiocese , the nation 's second-largest after los angeles , with 2.3 million parishioners , in 1982 . 


ironically , bernardin , who developed a progressive , much-praised programme to deal with pedophilia involving priests , became the highest-ranking church official ever accused of sexual improprieties when a former seminary student leveled charges in 1993 that he had been sexually abused by bernardin during the 1970s . 


bernardin steadfastly denied the charges and the former student later recanted his tale of abuse . 


bernardin prayed with him before he died from aids last year . 


bernardin , who became archbishop of cincinnati in 1972 , played an increasingly prominent role in the u.s. church as a moderate voice of compromise among liberals and conservatives in the ranks of the bishops . 


this month , he announced that he would oversee a series of conferences to find " common ground " among american catholics . 


previously , he was instrumental in drafting church policy on war , peace and nuclear arms , and for seven years he headed the bishops ' anti-abortion policy committee , espousing a policy describing human life as a " seamless garment . "

boatmen 's deal could spark more mergers . 


brad dorfman 


chicago 1996-08-30 


the $ 9.5 billion proposed acquisition of boatmen 's bancshares inc. by nationsbank corp. could spark a flurry of other mergers involving missouri banks , which until last year were protected from outside buyers by state regulations . 


" nationsbank just strolled into the midwest and bagged the biggest banking trophy in the landscape , " said michael ancell , banking industry analyst at edward d. jones & co . " 


whoever wants a big market position in the midwest has to come in and grab mercantile or commerce . " 


st. louis-based mercantile bancorp inc. , a bank holding company with $ 18.04 billion in assets , was seen by many analysts as the most attractive missouri franchise in size after boatmen 's . 


kansas city , mo.-based commerce bancshares inc. , with $ 9.32 billion in assets , also could help a regional bank establish a strong presence in the lower midwest , analysts added . 


" it focuses more attention on mercantile , commerce and roosevelt , " said james weber , analyst at a.g. edwards & sons . 


roosevelt financial group inc is a $ 9.33 billion asset-st . 


louis based thrift . 


" now ... the most coveted bank out there is mercantile , " weber said . 


mercantile and commerce did not return phone calls seeking comment . 


among those seen as having an interest in buying in missouri are minneapolis-based first bank system inc. and norwest corp. , ohio-based keycorp and banc one corp. , and first chicago nbd corp. in illinois . 


representatives of first bank , norwest , banc one and first chicago said the banks do not comment on rumors of possible mergers or acquisitions . 


keycorp , contacted by phone , would not comment . 


with a presence in nine states and $ 41 billion in assets , 


boatmen 's was the prize in missouri , where barriers to outside acquirers were brought down last year by a federal banking statute . 


" boatmen 's was the plum of missouri and was the plum of the central midwest , " weber said . 


talk that the missouri banks were seeking inflated prices from buyers was seen as a reason a deal has not occurred sooner . 


but nationsbank 's bid , representing a premium of 40 percent for boatmen 's stock , was large enough to get the deal done . 


" i think boatmen 's was shopping itself , and everybody knew if you wanted to be the winning buyer here , you had to make the bid nobody would beat , " ancell said . 


but some analysts cautioned that other targets should not expect as large a premium . 


they also questioned whether nationsbank can recoup shareholder value with such a large bid for boatmen 's . 


" i think initially some stocks will trade up on sympathy , but the wild premium nationsbank put on this deal here , i do n't see a lot of other deals being done at this premium , " said michael durante , analyst at mcdonald & co .

u.s. tight-lipped on libya 's award to farrakhan . 


washington 1996-08-30 


the state department refused to speculate on friday on what might happen in the case of louis farrakhan , the u.s. black leader who was awarded a $ 250,000 human rights prize by libya . 


" i 'm not going to speculate about what may or may not happen in that case , " state department spokesman glyn davies said . " 


... the view of the u.s. government on ( farrakhan 's ) not accepting any gifts from libya is well-known . " 


davies also noted : " we 've talked about the passport restriction for travel to libya " but he did not elaborate . 


the u.s. treasury department on wednesday denied farrakhan 's application to receive the $ 250,000 award or a $ 1 billion donation libyan leader muammar gaddafi had pledged to farrakhan 's nation of islam group after they met last january . 


farrakhan organised last october 's million man march that brought thousands of black men to washington for a peaceful rally . 


the treasury department said libya was on the u.s. list of states that sponsor international terrorism and noted that tripoli has refused to hand over two libyan suspects in the 1988 bombing of pan am flight 103 over lockerbie , scotland . 


that refusal led to the imposition of u.n. sanctions on libya .

titanic recovery mission is scrapped . 


new york 1996-08-30 


equipment problems and mechanical failure forced a recovery expedition to give up efforts to retrieve a giant slab of the rms titanic from the ocean floor , a spokeswoman said on friday . 


a 20-ton piece of the titanic 's steel hull , which had been attached by cables to a recovery ship off the coast of newfoundland , canada , fell back to the bottom of the sea , said erin purcell of boston-based reagan communications that represents two of the ships used in the expedition . 


the piece of hull , lifted from the ocean floor by means of several diesel-filled bags , had been stuck about 200 feet ( about 70 metres ) below the water 's surface before it fell , she said . 


it fell as recovery crews were trying to haul the piece into more shallow water and several of the bags burst and cables snapped , she said . 


the steel-hulled titanic , thought to be unsinkable , struck an iceberg on april 14 , 1912 , and sank , killing 1,523 of the 2,200 passengers and crew on board . 


the wreck was located in 1985 . 


passengers who had paid $ 1,500 and up to accompany the recovery expedition on two cruise ships had returned back to port on thursday , purcell said .

bonn appeals for middle east peace . 


bonn 1996-08-30 


the german government urged israelis and palestinians on friday to avoid any course of action that might jeopardise the peace process in the middle east . 


israel announced this week the expansion of jewish west bank settlements surrounding jerusalem and the demolition of an arab community centre in east jerusalem . 


city officials there said the centre was being erected illegally . 


but palestinian president yasser arafat said the moves by prime minister benjamin netanyahu 's government were tantamount to war . 


tension has been rising in the region since . 


" we believe that the israeli settlement policy in the occupied areas is an obstacle to the establishment of peace , " german foreign ministry spokesman martin erdmann said . 


" all concerned must avoid taking any course of action that could pose an obstacle to the peace process and which could make a peaceful solution difficult , " he said , as news came of a renewed breakdown in arab-israeli peace talks in jerusalem . 


erdmann told reporters bonn supported european union efforts to persuade israel to stop further jewish settlement on the west bank . 


the foreign ministry later announced israeli foreign minister david levy would visit bonn for talks with his german counterpart klaus kinkel next month . 


the ministry said levy and kinkel would discuss the middle east process and german-israeli relations at their meeting on september 9 . 


levy 's visit would be the first by an israeli cabinet minister since netanyahu 's conservative government took power in une this year , the ministry said . 


before levy 's arrival in bonn , german defence minister volker ruehe will visit israel from september 2 to 4 , the defence ministry said . 


ruehe planned to meet his israeli counterpart yitzhak mordechai and israeli president ezer weizman , the ministry said . 


he was also expected to meet prime minister netanyahu and opposition leader shimon peres for talks .

france expels african , air france unions protest . 


paris 1996-08-30 


france on friday expelled another african man seized in a police raid on a paris church as about 100 air france workers denounced " charters of shame " used to fly illegal immigrants home . 


a guinean man , detained in a round-up in the saint-bernard church a week ago , was deported on a scheduled air france flight to conakry after his appeals failed , a spokesman for air france 's pro-socialist cfdt union said . 


he was apparently the eighth african deported from among 210 people evicted from the church after a 50-day occupation aimed at securing residence permits , unions said . 


most of the others have been released after a brief stay in detention . 


about 100 people from the cfdt and the communist-led cgt unions marched outside air france headquarters at charles de gaulle airport north of paris against the use of civilian jets and staff in deporting illegal immigrants . 


" we must obtain a formal commitment from ( air france chairman ) christian blanc that no plane , no personnel be used to transform our air companies into charters of shame , " cfdt spokesman francois cabrera said . 


he said civilians should not be police accomplices . 


twenty-three out of 25 charters flying illegal immigrants home since prime minister alain juppe 's government took office in may 1995 have been civilian jets . 


the other two were military jets . 


separately , juppe confirmed the conservative government was preparing to submit a draft bill to parliament to tighten laws on illegal workers as part of a crackdown on immigration . 


" legislation is insufficient in several areas , notably in those concerning illegal work , " juppe told reporters .

canadian bonds open softer , spreads to u.s. shrink . 


toronto 1996-08-30 


canadian bonds opened softer on friday , pulled lower by a sinking u.s. market , but outperformed u.s. bonds on positive canadian economic data , analysts said . 


" i think this morning 's canadian numbers were very supportive of narrower spreads , particularly the current account number , " said jim webber , director of fixed-income research with td securities inc . 


canada 's 8.0 percent bond due 2023 fell c$ 0.45 to c$ 101.15 to yield 7.894 percent . 


the u.s. 30-year benchmark fell 30/32 to yield 7.12 percent . 


the spread between benchmark bonds narrowed 77 basis points from 81 basis points at the close of trading on wednesday . 


statistics canada on friday reported canada 's current account moved to a higher-than-expected c$ 1.15 billion second quarter surplus from a c$ 1.62 billion deficit in the first quarter . 


it was the first surplus since the fourth quarter of 1984 . 


the agency also reported canada 's real gross domestic product rose a weaker-than-expected 0.3 percent in the second quarter or 1.3 percent at an annualized rate . 


while the data provided support for canadian bonds , both canadian and u.s. markets weakened after the release of strong u.s. economic data , including a report showing the chicago purchasing managers august index rose to 60 from 51.2 in july . 


" the purchasing managers ' number is extremely , extremely strong , " said webber . 


in other news , the toronto bond traders ' association said it is recommending that dealings in the canadian bond market end early at 1400 edt / 1800 gmt on friday . 


the canadian market typically closes early on holiday weekends and canadian financial markets will be closed on monday for labour day . 


in other prices , the 7.0 percent of 2006 fell c$ 0.28 to c$ 96.89 to yield 7.437 percent . 


the u.s. 10-year benchmark fell 21/32 to yield 6.95 percent . 


the spread between the two bonds narrowed to 49 basis points from 54 basis points at the close of trading on thursday . 


the three-month cash bill traded at 4.04 percent against the u.s. three-month bill at 5.26 percent .

syria slams israel on settlements . 


damascus 1996-08-30 


syria on friday condemned israel 's settlement policy and said prime minister benjamin netanyahu was preparing for war with arabs . 


" practices of the israeli government , especially its settlement activities , came to confirm that dealing with this government inflicts the biggest harm on the arab cause , " state-run damascus radio said in a commentary . 


" when this government insists on stabbing the peace process and tearing it apart , this means that it is preparing for war , " the radio said . 


palestinian president yasser arafat described this week the decision to expand settlements in the west bank as a declaration of war . 


palestinians in the west bank and gaza observed a strike on thursday to protest against the israeli move . 


the radio urged arabs to unify their ranks to thwart the policies of the right-wing israeli government . 


" israel could not confront a united arab stand or usurp their rights because the arab rights could be regained when they achieve unity and solidarity , " damascus radio said . 


it welcomed the international criticism of israel 's settlement policies but called for practical steps to force the israeli government to abandon this policy . 


" it is important to translate the criticism into pressuring action to prevent israel from undermining the big international efforts aimed at making the peace process achieve success , " the radio said . 


syria and arabs have been dismayed by netanyahu 's refusal to trade the occupied arab lands for peace , his support for the expansion of settlements and his insistance on jerusalem as a unifed capital for israel . 


syria has held sporadic peace talks with israel since 1991 without achieving a breakthrough .

egypt police detain 26 suspected moslem militants . 


cairo 1996-08-30 


police have detained 26 suspected members of egypt 's largest militant group al-gama'a al-islamiya ( islamic group ) , government newspapers reported on friday . 


they said police arrested the militants in the eastern sharqiyah province after capturing their leader rami al-saadani in a satellite city outside cairo . 


al-akhbar newspapers said the men had been plotting against " strategic institutions and prominent individuals " but gave no other details . 


the newspapers said the men were being interrogated . 


state security officials were not immediately available for comment . 


more than 960 people have been killed in the armed struggle the gama'a launched in 1992 to topple president hosni mubarak 's government and establish a purist islamic state in its place

israel blocks palestinian pilgrims ' progress . 


sami aboudi 


al-ram , west bank 1996-08-30 


kamil jamil did n't have a prayer . 


an israeli roadblock stopped the 38-year-old palestinian from answering yasser arafat 's call to worship at jerusalem 's al-aqsa mosque on friday . 


" go home . 


there are no prayers today , " an israeli soldier yelled at jamil in hebrew . 


palestinian president arafat , attacking israel 's decision to expand jewish settlements and its policy on jerusalem , went before the palestinian legislature on wednesday to urge the two million arabs in the west bank and gaza to go to the holy city . 


pilgrims stood little chance of making progress . 


palestinians have been banned by israel from travelling from the west bank to jerusalem since suicide bombings by moslem militants killed 59 people in the jewish state in february and march . 


and israeli checkpoints have circled jerusalem since 1993 , a concrete and constant reminder of israel 's hold on a city it considers its eternal capital . 


the plo wants arab east jerusalem as the capital of a future palestinian state . 


only a few palestinians trickled to the roadblocks . 


they were immediately turned back . 


" i am heeding abu ammar 's ( arafat 's ) call to pray at al-aqsa and i came . 


it is our duty towards al-aqsa to come and pray , " jamil said . 


a tourist from jordan was also told by israeli soldiers at the al-ram checkpoint that he could not enter jerusalem . 


" we have a peace treaty with them and we let them go wherever they want when they come to jordan , " said the tourist , khaled hijazi , 37 . " 


i feel terrible . 


i am entitled to see jerusalem , " he said . 


some palestinians took to back roads , only to run into waiting israeli security forces . 


" the israelis have no right to prevent us from going to pray . 


what kind of peace is this that prevents us from reaching our holy places ? " 


asked mustafa hoshiyeh , a 27-year-old west bank labourer turned around by a police patrol on a back road . 


" abu ammar ( arafat ) is right . 


we have signed a peace treaty with the israelis but on the ground , we see that nothing has changed , " said 20-year-old ali ahmed from qalandia refugee camp .

consumer spending , incomes edge up in july . 


glenn somerville 


washington 1996-08-30 


consumer spending barely edged up in july , the commerce department said friday , as income growth slowed abruptly to the weakest pace in six months . 


spending rose 0.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 5.15 trillion after dropping a revised 0.4 percent in june . 


incomes from wages , salaries and all other sources gained 0.1 percent to a rate of $ 6.47 trillion after a 0.9 percent jump in june . 


department officials said july 's slight gain in incomes was the weakest for any month since january , when they were flat . 


wages and salaries came under pressure in july as a shorter average workweek and lower hourly earnings cut into paychecks . 


the department said wages and salaries decreased by $ 6.9 billion in july after climbing $ 45 billion in june . 


" in july , average weekly hours and average hourly earnings declined , more than offsetting the effect of an increase in employment , " commerce said . 


but more money went into savings accounts , as savings held at 5.3 cents out of each dollar earned in both june and july . 


that was the highest savings rate since october last year , when 5.5 cents out of each dollar earned was being saved . 


the generally lackluster report on spending and incomes in july had been expected . 


at the same time , the department said in a separate report that new orders received by u.s. factories climbed strongly in july , with widespread gains across most major categories . 


orders increased 1.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted $ 317.6 billion , significantly stronger than the 1 percent rise forecast by wall street economists . 


that followed a revised 0.7 percent decline in june orders . 


commerce said previously that spending at retail stores was up only 0.1 percent in july , partly because of softer sales of new cars and light trucks . 


in addition , the labour department 's july employment report had foreshadowed the muted income growth . 


it showed average hourly earnings fell in july by 0.2 percent to $ 11.00 and the average workweek shortened to 34.3 hours from 34.7 in june . 


gains in personal income , which includes wages and salaries as well as income from sources such as dividends , interest and businesses , are essential for funding consumer purchases , which fuel two-thirds of national economic activity . 


spending on all types of durable goods , which includes cars , fell to an annual rate of $ 626.3 billion in july from $ 633.6 billion in june . 


but spending on nondurable products increased moderately to a rate of $ 1.55 trillion from $ 1.54 trillion in june , while spending for services was up to $ 2.97 trillion in july from $ 2.96 trillion . 


payrolls of manufacturing companies rose in july by $ 2.3 billion to an annual rate of $ 678 billion .

stocks sink as bond rates jump on strong data 


blue-chip stocks sank to their biggest loss since mid-july thursday as fresh signs of a surprisingly strong economy boosted long-term bond interest rates above 7 percent . 


the dollar rose slightly against the german mark , but edged lower against the japanese yen . 


the dow jones industrial average ended down 64.73 points at 5,647.65 , its largest drop since july 15 , when it closed with a loss of 161 points . 


in the broader market , declining issues beat advances 1,627 to 743 on moderate volume of 321 million shares on the new york stock exchange . 


in the bond market , the 30-year treasury bond fell 23/32 of a point , or $ 7.1875 on a $ 1,000 bond , raising its yield to 7.04 percent -- the highest since july 31 -- from 6.98 percent at wednesday 's close . 


" seven percent creates psychological problems and a legitimate competitor for money from equities , " said ralph bloch , chief technical analyst at raymond james . 


" we could carry another 100 points lower in the dow , " he said . " 


i 'm telling clients things are dicey going into next friday ( sept .

wall street on sept . 


6 faces the key monthly employment report , which has been known to cause dramatic swings in stock prices . 


" we had two very strong economic reports , " said david shulman , salomon bros . ' 


chief equity strategist . " 


there are more worries in bond land . 


fears of a fed tightening next month have resurfaced for the first time since the end of july . " 


the commerce department reported that the nation 's gross domestic product expanded at a 4.8 percent annual rate in the three months from april through june instead of the 4.2 percent estimated a month ago . 


in another report , sales of new homes jumped unexpectedly in july to the briskest rate in five months , driving prices up in a strong housing market . 


sales shot up 7.9 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 783,000 units -- the strongest since february , when new homes were selling at a rate of 784,000 a year . 


analysts said the stock market was also worried about the impact on president clinton 's re-election bid of his top political strategist resigning . 


dick morris , who is credited with resurrecting clinton 's political fortunes over the past 18 months by masterminding his turn to the political centre , quit after a supermarket tabloid reported he engaged in a yearlong affair with a prostitute , with whom he allegedly shared confidential campaign documents . 


analysts said wall street had grown accustomed to a moderate republican in the form of democratic president clinton . 


morris ' departure raised fears that clinton would veer more to the left in a second term . 


the dollar closed at 1.4772 marks , up from 1.4767 late wednesday . 


the dollar slipped to 108.40 yen from 108.45 . 


oil markets rose sharply on a combination of low stocks , two hurricanes and allegations of illicit trading by iraq . 


september heating oil on the new york mercantile exchange closed 1.63 cents higher at 63.67 cents a gallon , september unleaded gasoline finished 1.39 cents up at 63.72 cents a gallon and october crude rose 44 cents to $ 22.15 a barrel . 


december cotton closed 0.95 cent higher at 77.06 cents per pound on the new york cotton exchange despite some easing of concern about the twin hurricane threat to key u.s. growing areas with forecasts indicating both storms may remain offshore . 


overseas , london 's ftse 100 index had earlier climbed to 3,8921.1 just below its record of 3,922.1 , before edging down through the afternoon session to finish the day at 3,885.0 , a fall of 33.7 points .

pirelli cables look to tap chinese growth . 


david jones 


milan 1996-08-30 


italian tyre and cables giant pirelli on friday announced its long-awaited move into china with a cables joint venture set to capitalise on the rapidly-growing chinese telecommunications market . 


pirelli is linking with hong kong-based group citic pacific in a venture to be called the wuxi tong ling company ltd , which will operate in partnership with a local industrial company at its existing factory in wuxi , jiangsu province , shanghai . 


the partners will invest around $ 30 million in the existing copper cable plant at wuxi to update technology and include optic fibre production , with annual turnover expected to reach $ 60 million within the next few years . 


the move marks a further move by pirelli 's cables division to expand in the fast-growing far eastern developing markets with the group already present in indonesia , india and malaysia . 


" this is really positive news for pirelli , and i expect that it will produce one of the best half-year results in late september compared to other industrial italian companies , " said analyst paula buratti at indosuez . 


she emphasised that the move was positive because pirelli will have management control of the chinese venture , and it also showed another example of pirelli exporting its technical know-how to developing markets . 


pirelli shares reacted favourable even though talks had been underway for some time and news about a venture had been widely expected . 


the shares rose 0.2 percent to 2,555 lire by 1350 gmt in an easier milan stock market . 


this will be pirelli 's first industrial involvement in a chinese market where demand for telecommunication networks is expected to grow to 80-100 million new lines between 1996 and 2000 , doubling demand for optical cables . 


china 's second largest telecoms operator unicom already has a mandate from the central government to establish 15 million new phone lines by the year 2000 , which will necessitate new trunk line systems and local distribution networks . 


" the starting of this production base in china has for our group an undoubted strategic value , representing an important enhancement of our presence in asia , " said pirelli spa chairman and chief executive officer marco tonchetti provera . 


pirelli cables has global sales of over $ 3.5 billion , and has become a large supplier of optic cables and systems to major telecoms carriers in the u.s. , europe and the far east . 


citic pacific is a major hong kong-listed company focusing on infrastruture , trading , distribution and property , with 28 percent of its 1995 profits coming from telecoms . 


it has investments in several industrial joint ventures in china .

dutch bond futures revival delayed - eoe . 


amsterdam 1996-08-30 


a broad attempt to spur activity in dutch bond futures has been delayed to give participants a chance to become familiar with the trading system , the european options exchange ( eoe ) said on friday . 


market-making in the rarely-traded fto contract was expected to begin today , but an eoe spokesman said the 10 banks and brokers involved in the initiative needed time to get accustomed to changes in the electronic trading system . 


" it 's not ready yet . 


we found it wise to take some time between the commitment to start and the actual start , " eoe spokesman lex van drooge told reuters . 


he said no date had been fixed yet for the start of price making in the 10-year contract , but the eoe had agreed to speak again to the participants in one to two weeks . 


investors in dutch bonds currently use german bond futures to hedge their portfolios because the fto contract is so illiquid . 


a limited attempt to reinvigorate the contract two years ago failed .

osce defends record over chechnya peace mission . 


bonn 1996-08-30 


the head of an international mediating mission defended its record on friday in the face of criticism by pro-moscow leaders in breakway chechnya and insisted it was doing its best to bring peace to the region . 


flavio cotti , the chairman of the organisation for security and cooperation in europe ( osce ) , told german radio the vienna-based body viewed the conflict in chechnya as an internal russian problem . 


" the osce is completely involved . 


but one must not forget that the osce only has limited powers there , " said cotti , who is also the swiss foreign minister . " 


our mission in chechnya has done all it can within the given limitations . " 


pro-moscow leaders in chechnya have criticised tim guldimann , the swiss diplomat who heads the osce chechnya mission , saying he was biased toward zelimkhan yandarbiyev , president of the self-declared separatist government . 


russian peacemaker alexander lebed and chechen separatist military leader aslan maskhadov started a new round of peace talks on friday just outside the rebel region . 


cotti said chechnya must remain part of russia , but the solution to the conflict would be to accord the region maximum autonomy within russia 's borders . 


" there is no doubt that chechnya , according to osce principles , belongs to a state called russia , " he said , pointing out that russia was an osce member and it was not the organisation 's policy to challenge members ' sovereignty . 


he added that the osce was the only international body which has been allowed into the chechnya to monitor the human rights situation there , but that its means were restricted by the fact that the conflict was a " internal issue " . 


" we have a small concept , the details of which have yet to be worked out . 


chechnya must be accorded the maximum autonomy possible within the framework of russian integrity , " said cotti .

dutch say no reason to reopen el al carqo enquiry . 


the hague 1996-08-30 


the dutch transport minister annemarie jorritsma told the country ' second chamber that there is no further need to investigate the 1992 crash of an el al freighter which left 43 dead in an amsterdam suburb . 


she said that a request from her ministry for the aircraft 's waybill documentation and further information about the contents of its hold had been complied with by el al 's head office in tel aviv . 


the dutch transport ministry had come in for pressure from a cross-section of dutch members of parliaments in may this year , some of whom believed the aircraft had been carrying unlisted , dangerous goods . 


others said they thought the aircraft was loaded with too much airfreight . 


jorritsma said the latest evidence from el al in no way supported the allegations , and added there is no justification for a further investigation into the incident .

armenians , azeris hold peace talks in germany . 


bonn 1996-08-30 


representatives from armenia and azerbaijan held talks earlier this week in germany on bringing a lasting peace to the disputed nagorno-karabakh region , a diplomatic source close to the talks said on friday . 


the source , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said azerbaijani presidential adviser vafa gulizade and his armenian counterpart zhirayr liparityan met to discuss the disputed enclave on wednesday and had now flown home . 


an uneasy ceasefire has prevailed in nagorno-karabakh , which represents around 20 percent of azeri territory , since may 1994 after ethnic armenians drove azeris out of the region . 


the conflict , which began in 1988 , claimed over 10,000 lives . 


" the main subject ( of the talks ) was the search for a peaceful solution for nagorno-karabakh , " the source said . 


he declined to reveal any more details about the content of the talks or their exact location in germany . 


azerbaijan has said it is prepared to grant autonomy to nagorno-karabakh if armenian forces pull out , but will not accept armenia 's demands for the independence of the enclave . 


russia 's interfax news agency reported on tuesday the officials had departed for negotiations in germany , adding that face-to-face talks between the two sides first took place last december in amsterdam . 


interfax said the discussions were being held in parallel with peace talks mediated by the organisation for security and cooperation in europe ( osce ) and the broad-based minsk group of countries led by russia and finland .

sombre mood on arctic island after plane crash . 


rolf soderlind 


longyear , norway 1996-08-30 


the windblown , chilly streets of this tiny arctic town are all but deserted and flags are flying at half-mast beneath a brooding , clouded sky . 


longyear is a town in mourning , a close-knit community that has been shattered . 


disaster struck on thursday when a russian airliner bringing coal miners to work crashed as it came in to land at the airport , killing all 141 people on board . 


" it 's a sight i will never forget . 


i will remember it for the rest of my life , " said stig onarheim . 


he was one of a handful of rescuers who raced to the scene of the crash in a helicopter on thursday , hoping in vain to find survivors . 


the plane smashed into a snow-capped mountain on the arctic island of spitzbergen on thursday , just east of longyear . 


" imagine a big plane with a lot of luggage and people on board . 


think of all that mixed together , with twisted , wrecked parts on the slope , " onarheim , 29 , told reuters . 


police and local officials have sealed off the crash site , protecting it from intrusive reporters and from the polar bears that roam freely across the icy expanses . 


the dead were all russians and ukrainians , coming to work in the mining towns of barentsburg and pyramiden . 


longyear is a norwegian settlement of just over 1,000 people , but it also feels the loss keenly . 


" i have trouble finding the words to express my grief . 


it 's a tragedy for everyone . 


we know many of the people who live in barentsburg , some of them could have been on the plane , " said johan sletten , 52 . 


sletten , a caretaker who has lived on the island for 30 years , said the norwegian and russian communities visit frequently , competing at soccer in the summer and with snow-scooter races in the winter . 


teenage shop assistant heidi groenstein was blunter . 


" i 'm glad it was not a norwegian plane , " she said . " 


just think of it -- a mining village where so many workers die . 


they must be having a tough time of it now . " 


barentsburg , just a few hours ride by snow-scooter or 15 minutes by helicopter from longyear , has asked to be left alone with its grief and told reporters to stay away . 


around 100 russian and ukrainian miners were waiting in longyear to fly home on the plane that crashed . 


they were given shelter in the town 's church overnight and ate a sombre breakfast before getting on a bus for the airport . 


another plane had been sent from moscow to pick them up . 


at this time of year , the only colour in longyear comes from the brightly-painted wooden houses . 


everything else is muddy , the waters of the fjord leaden . 


winter is in the air . 


barentsburg is an even grimmer place , a run-down testament to the hardships of the new russia . 


spitzbergen lies some 500 miles ( 800 km ) off the northern tip of norway and endures one of the most extreme climates on the planet . 


inhabited by fewer than 3,000 people in total , it sees the sun for 24 hours a day during summer and is plunged into round-the-clock darkness in the winter months . 


the terrain is mountainous , the only roads are dirt tracks . 


norway rules the island group under the terms of a 1920s international treaty which gave many other nations the right to establish setttlements and exploit the coal that is still mined there . 


only russia has chosen to do so .

hong kong financial secretary donald tsang said on friday that the territory had the " infrastructural hardware " to make a success of its future under chinese sovereignty from mid-1997 . 


" we have the largest and most efficient port on the south china coast ; we have the best transport and telecommunications infrastructure in the world ; and we are investing in this hardware on an enormous scale , " tsang said in a speech to auckland during a visit to new zealand . 


hong kong also had the necessary " constitutional infrastructure " in place , with the promise of autonomy in running its affairs after the handover from britain to china . 


" what this means in practice is that hong kong will go on raising its own taxes , issuing its own currency , setting its own expenditure priorities and managing its own enormous financial reserves , " tsang said . 


he acknowledged that many hong kong people had decided to seek their future elsewhere and others were sure to follow in the next nine months . " 


but for the great majority of us , hong kong is our home and hong kong 's future is our future . "

arafat goes to nablus ahead of cabinet meeting . 


nablus , west bank 1996-08-30 


palestinian president yasser arafat arrived in the west bank self-rule enclave of nablus from ramallah on friday , witnesses said . 


his aides said arafat would hold the weekly meeting of the palestinian self-rule authority 's cabinet in nablus on saturday . 


in jerusalem , israeli security forces were bracing for thousands of palestinians expected to answer arafat 's call earlier this week to come to the city holy to moslems , arabs and jews to pray in protest against israel 's settlement policy in the west bank and delay in peace negotiations . 


palestinians want arab east jerusalem as the capital of a future independent state . 


israel , which captured and annexed east jerusalem in 1967 , says it will never cede any part of the city . 


arafat , who made an interim peace deal with israel in 1993 that set up self-rule , says he will only visit jerusalem once israeli occupation has ended .

u.n. council concerned about israeli bulldozers . 


united nations 1996-08-29 


security council members expressed concern on thursday that israel 's bulldozing of a palestinian day-care centre for the disabled might further injure the middle east peace process . 


responding to a letter from the the palestinian u.n. observer mission , security council president tono eitel of germany said that members asked him to convey their views to israel 's charge d'affaires , david peleg . 


" the members expressed their concern about the maintenance of the peace process and they urged that no action be taken that would have a negative impact on the negotiations , " eitel said after an informal council session . 


" they asked me to call in the israeli charge d'affaires and discuss the matter with him , " he added . 


the palestinian letter from marwan jilani said the destruction of the jerusalem centre was an effort by israel to " alter the character , demographic composition and status of the holy city of jerusalem " and violated agreements between israel and the palestinian liberation organisation . 


" this most recent measure represents a revival of old , malicious plans to confiscate the land and build units for israeli settlers within the walls of the old city . " 


" we expect the international community to take a clear and firm position , based on international law and in accordance with u.n. resolutions , against all such israeli violations and illegal practices , " he said . 


on tuesday , israeli crews hoisted a bulldozer over the walls of jerusalem 's old city and demolished the centre , saying it was being restored without a building permit . 


canada had recently donated $ 30 million to the centre , called the burj al-laqlaq society .

soccer - real scrape 1-1 draw in scrappy opening match . 


la coruna , spain 1996-08-31 


a late goal by newly-signed defender roberto carlos saved the blushes of real madrid coach fabio capello and his multi-billion peseta line-up in the opening game of the spanish championship on saturday . 


the brazilian 's 79th-minute effort was enough to earn real a point from a scrappy 1-1 draw at fellow title contenders deportivo coruna . 


deportivo started strongly , taking the lead midway through the first half when former auxerre playmaker corentine martins headed home a corner after a flick-on by brazilian-born spanish international midfielder donato . 


real looked to be in deep trouble shortly after the break when luis milla was sent off for committing two bookable offences in as many minutes . 


but deportivo were unable to capitalise on their numerical advantage , and were themselves reduced to ten men when armando alvarez was sent off 15 minutes from time . 


shortly afterwards roberto carlos found space in the home defence and equalised for real with a shot that was deflected past despairing deportivo ' keeper jacques songo'o . 


in a frantic final five minutes there were chances at both ends , and donato , who had earlier been booked , was sent off for protesting about the incursion of real players at a free kick . 


before the match deportivo chairman augusto lendoiro said he would ignore a fifa decision banning brazilian midfielder mauro silva from playing in the match for failing to join his national side 's tour of europe . 


in the event , coach john toshack decided not to use silva , who had claimed he did not join the brazil squad because he had lost his passport .

arlington , texas 1996-08-31 


juan gonzalez homered twice and ivan rodriguez added a two-run shot as the texas rangers defeated the cleveland indians 5-3 in a matchup of division leaders friday . 


rodriguez 's 18th homer , off chad ogea ( 7-5 ) in the first , gave texas a 2-0 lead . 


one out later , gonzalez smacked his 40th homer , extending his hitting streak to 20 games . 


gonzalez , who hit in 21 straight games earlier this season , joined mickey rivers as the only players in texas history with two 20-game streaks in the same year . 


gonzalez hit his second homer in the third for his fifth multi-homer game of the season . 


gonzalez has three 40-homer seasons and his 121 rbi broke ruben sierra 's team record of 119 set in 1989 . 


the indians had their four-game winning streak stopped . 


" it 's not something i 'm going to try to explain , " said texas manager johnny oates about his team winning seven of the 10 meetings from cleveland this season . 


" we 've got two more regular season games against them and we might get lucky enough or unlucky enough to play them in the post-season . "

jeff russell pitched two perfect innings for his third save .

at california , tino martinez 's two-run homer keyed a three-run first and andy pettitte became the league 's first 19-game winner as the new york yankees beat the angels 6-2 . 


new york snapped a season-high five-game losing streak and also got homers from mariano duncan , darryl strawberry and jim leyritz . 


pettite ( 19-7 ) allowed two runs and eight hits over eight innings with a walk and seven strikeouts . 


he improved to 12-2 following yankees ' losses . 


mariano rivera pitched a scoreless ninth , striking out two . 


ex-yankee randy velarde hit his 11th homer , his most at any professional level . 


in seattle , pete incaviglia 's grand slam with one out in the sixth snapped a tie and lifted the baltimore orioles past the seattle mariners , 5-2 . 


it was incaviglia 's sixth grand slam and 200th homer of his career . 


baltimore 's eddie murray cracked his 20th homer of the season and 499th of his career . 


jay buhner hit his 38th homer and edgar martinez his 23rd for seattle . 


the orioles remained tied with the white sox for the american league wild card with the mariners a game back . 


in toronto , kevin tapani ( 12-8 ) allowed two runs and six hits over 7 1/3 innings and frank thomas hit his 29th homer and drove in three runs as the chicago white sox cruised to an 11-2 victory over the blue jays . 


thomas , harold baines and robin ventura each collected three hits . 


baines homered and scored three runs . 


danny tartabull added two hits and three rbi as all chicago starters got at least one hit . 


in oakland , dave telgheder scattered seven hits over eight innings and mark mcgwire hit his major-league leading 45th homer and drove in three runs as the athetlics blanked the boston red sox 7-0 .

van poppel ( 3-6 ) walked two and struck out two in defeating the royals for the second time this week . 


he threw 108 pitches as he lowered his era from 8.08 to 7.24 .

cricket - essex and kent made to sweat in title race . 


london 1996-08-31 


essex and kent both face tense finishes on monday as they attempt to keep pace with title hopefuls derbyshire and surrey , convincing three-day victors on saturday , in the english county championship run-in . 


essex need another 148 with five wickets in hand to beat yorkshire after a maiden first-class century from richard kettleborough transformed a match which his side had seemed certain to lose . 


kent will also need to keep their nerve against struggling nottinghamshire who will enter the final day 137 ahead with four wickets left in a relatively low-scoring match at tunbridge wells . 


derbyshire , nine-wicket winners over worcestershire , and surrey , who thrashed warwickshire by an innings and 164 runs , can instead take the day off along with rivals leicestershire , who beat somerset inside two days . 


warwickshire captain tim munton is tipping surrey to emerge on top , impressed by the positive influence of australian coach dave gilbert , but derbyshire 's australian captain dean jones is conceding nothing as his side chase their first title for 60 years . 


" we took three absolutely brilliant catches in this match and our catching all season has been pretty impressive . 


our catching will win or lose us the championship , " he said .

rugby union - lynagh seals victory over dwyer and leicester . 


london 1996-08-31 


former wallaby captain michael lynagh began his career in english club rugby in impeccable fashion on saturday to frustrate his old coach bob dwyer on his league coaching debut with leicester . 


lynagh kicked five penalties and a conversion from his six attempts at goal to steer his multi-national saracens side to a 25-23 home win and offer millionaire backer nigel wray an early return on his big investment in the north london club . 


french centre philippe sella also enjoyed a good game alongside lynagh , although the home team scored only one try through england scrum-half kyran bracken . 


the new french connection at harlequins also made a good start , laurent cabannes and laurent benezech scoring a try apiece in their side 's 75-19 victory over gloucester . 


former england captain will carling , handed the kicking duties , finished with 20 points . 


with the first day of the league season briefly shifting the spotlight away from the discord between the clubs and the rugby football union , there were also emphatic victories for champions bath , 56-13 winners over orrell , and northampton and narrow successes for wasps and bristol .

rugby union - springboks finally break all black spell . 


andy colquhoun 


johannesburg 1996-08-31 


south africa managed to avoid a fifth successive defeat in 1996 at the hands of the all blacks with an emphatic 32-22 victory in front of an ecstatic ellis park crowd on saturday . 


they scored three tries in recording their highest total against new zealand , salvaging some pride in a season in which the world champions have lost five out of eight tests . 


it also ended a run of nine successive victories this year for new zealand but arrived too late to prevent a 2-1 series defeat and an historic first all black series triumph on south african soil . 


springbok scrum-half joost van der westhuizen was his side 's inspiration , scoring their opening try and making the third for flanker andre venter from a quickly taken penalty to give his side a 29-8 lead after 54 minutes . 


fullback andre joubert scored the other , scorching in from 40 metres at the start of the second half to add to his three long-range penalties . 


the all blacks salvaged some pride by scoring two tries from centre walter little and scrum-half justin marshall in the final five minutes to close a gap which at one point stood at 24 points . 


but they generally endured an off-day , highlighted by recalled fly-half andrew mehrtens who missed five out of eight kicks at goal . 


recalled fly-half henry honiball kicked the springboks into a 6-0 lead after 10 minutes only to see andrew mehrtens launch a penalty from eight metres inside his own half to narrow the gap . 


mehrtens missed three further penalties and a conversion in the first 40 minutes which could have put his side ahead , but it was the springboks who looked the more dangerous . 


their promise was realised when joubert made a 40-metre break in the 25th minute and , although winger pieter hendriks appeared to knock on joubert 's reverse pass , welsh referee derek bevan allowed van der westhuizen to pick up and score under the posts . 


honiball converted and joubert kicked a penalty before all black hooker sean fitzpatrick scored a try from close range on the stroke of half-time to narrow the lead to 16-8 and hint at a comeback . 


instead joubert kicked another long penalty and then raced around the outside of the defence to score the springboks ' second try . 


a quick penalty from van der westhuizen five metres from the all black line set up the third try for venter five minutes later and when joubert kicked his third penalty the springboks held an unassailable 32-8 lead going into the last quarter . 


when the all blacks did break through , it was too late . 


centre walter little followed up mehrtens ' kick to score under the posts and scrum-half justin marshall forced himself over from a ruck close to the line in injury-time to give them some consolation . 


south africa - 15 - andre joubert , 14 - justin swart , 13 - japie mulder ( joel stransky , 48 mins ) 12 - danie van schalkwyk , 11 - pieter hendriks ; 10 - henry honiball , 9 - joost van der westhuizen ; 8 - gary teichmann ( captain ) , 7 - andre venter ( wayne fyvie , 75 ) , 6 - ruben kruge , 5 - mark andrews ( fritz van heerden , 39 ) , 4 - kobus wiese , 3 - marius hurter , 2 - james dalton , 1 - dawie theron ( garry pagel , 66 ) .

england 's irrepressible midfielder paul gascoigne was up to his old tricks on saturday , pulling down his team mate paul ince 's trousers in front of an astonished crowd in moldova . 


ince was clambering over a wall at the republican stadium in chisinau as glenn hoddle 's england players tried to escape heavy rain during an under-21 clash . 


gascoigne , whose compulsive practical joking has landed him in trouble in the past , tugged down the inter milan player 's trousers in front of a group of press photographers .

squash - hill brands world champion jansher a cheat . 


hong kong 1996-08-31 


controversial australian anthony hill called jansher khan a cheat during his acrimonious defeat by the world number one in the hong kong open semifinals on saturday . 


the match boiled over when hill made to walk off court after what he claimed was a game-winning point in the third . 


when the referee called jansher 's return good and the decision was accepted by the player , hill shrieked at the pakistani : " you cheat . " 


" he was standing right there and knew the shot was down so i called him a cheat , " said hill , whose squash career has been blighted by fines and suspensions for unacceptable behaviour . 


" he knew it was down and accepted what i called him because of that . " 


hill won the game on the next point and said later that jansher was generally honest on court but played by the referee 's decision . 


the australian had upset jansher 's rhythm with his mixture of gamesmanship and fluent stroke-making but eventually succumbed 15-7 17-15 14-15 15-8 . 


" i changed my strategy against him today and had him rattled , " he added . 


he is not as fit as he used to be be but was too good for me in the end . 


i shook him a bit but he will come out next time and be a better player for it -- that 's jansher . " 


jansher said that he was disturbed to be called a cheat . " 


what he did was bad for squash , bad for the crowd and bad for the sponsors . 


" we are trying to build up squash like tennis and players should not say things like that . 


" i think the professional squash association should look into this matter and deal with it properly . 


i am not calling for him to be banned but they have to take some action . " 


jansher , bidding for an eighth hong kong open title , plays second-seeded australian rodney eyles in the final . 


eyles played his best squash of the tournament to beat fourth-seeded peter nicol of scotland 15-10 8-15 15-10 15-4 . 


eyles , who defeated jansher in the semifinals of the portuguese open in 1993 , said that he would like to win for the good of the game . 


" i have nothing against jansher but it will be great if i could beat him , " said eyles . " 


my biggest problem against jansher is concentration . 


i want to beat him so badly that i just cannot get it together . "

golf - parnevik takes one-shot lead at greater milwaukee open . 


milwaukee , wisconsin 1996-08-31 


jesper parnevik of sweden fired a course record-tying eight-under-par 63 saturday to take a one-shot lead into the final round of the $ 1.2 million greater milwaukee open . 


parnevik , who is seeking his first pga tour victory , moved to 19-under 194 for the tournament . 


parnevik tied the 18-hole record set by loren roberts in 1994 at the brown deer park golf course and also equalled saturday by greg kraft . 


nolan henke , who led by two strokes entering the third round , carded a four-under 67 and was one stroke back at 18-under 195 . 


he is striving for his fourth career pga tour victory and first since the 1993 bellsouth classic . 


tiger woods , who made the cut in his first tournament as a professional , shot a two-over-par 73 and was four under for the tournament . 


the 20-year-old woods , who turned professional tuesday after winning an unprecedented third successive u.s. amateur championship , struggled on the front nine , bogeying the first and seventh holes and double-bogeying the par-four , 359-yard ninth hole . 


after bogeying the 10th hole to move to four-over for the round , he rallied for birdies on 15 and 18 . 


after parnevik started off his round by parring the first hole and bogeying the second , the swede birdied six of the next seven holes . 


parnevik continued to storm through the course , birdying three holes on the back nine , including two from 12 feet out on the 15th and 17th holes . 


" i ca n't remember when i 've putted this well , " said parnevik . " 


i was disappointed when a 12-footer did n't go in . 


" my game feels very good . 


i 've been fading my driver but today whenever i set up for a fade it went straight . 


whenever everyone 's making birdies , you never want to be even par . " 


henke had a bogey-free round and birdied four holes , including a 45-footer on the par-three 215-yard seventh hole and one from 12 feet out on the 12th hole . 


" i did n't hit it very well today , " said henke . " 


jasper blew right by me . 


once he did , i knew i had to make birdies just to keep up . 


i made some really good pars . 


i basically picked up where i left off yesterday afternoon . 


" right now , i ca n't put my finger on what 's wrong . " 


bob estes shot a 67 for sole possession of third place at 15-under . 


steve stricker , who tied for second at last week 's world series of golf , and stuart appleby were both five shots off the lead at 14 under . 


duffy waldorf , who also tied for second at the world series of golf , carded a 70 to lead a group of six golfers at 13 under , including kraft . 


the top four on the pga tour money list all skipped the tournament .

tennis - spain , u.s. teams open on road for 1997 fed cup . 


richard finn 


new york 1996-08-31 


this year 's fed cup finalists -- defending champion spain and the united states -- will hit the road to open the 1997 women 's international team competition , based on the draw conducted saturday at the u.s. open . 


spain travels to belgium , while the u.s. team heads to the netherlands for first-round matches march 1-2 . 


the other two first-round ties will pit hosts germany against the czech republic and visiting france against japan . 


the semifinals are july 19-20 , and the final september 27- 28 . 


life on the road this year did not slow the americans , who will try to avenge their 3-2 defeat in the final last year when they host spain on september 28-29 in atlantic city . 


" last year we stood on the court after we had lost and we put out hands together and made it our committment to bring back the cup , " u.s. captain billie jean king said at the draw . " 


that is our sole goal . " 


the united states edged austria in salzburg 3-2 in the opening round in april , and then blanked japan 5-0 in nagoya last month in the semifinals . 


the victory against japan marked the fed cup debut of monica seles , who became a naturalised u.s. citizen in 1994 . 


seles easily won both her singles matches and king is counting on the co-world number one to lead the team again . 


" i told monica we need her if we want to win , " king said . 


seles 's sore left shoulder and a wrist injury to fed cup veteran mary joe fernandez have forced king to take a wait and see attitude regarding her squad for the best-of-five match . 


fernandez was forced to withdraw from the u.s. open . 


" we will wait until the last minute so we check with everybody and their injuries , " said king . " 


what we like would be seles , ( olympic champion lindsay ) davenport and mary joe fernandez . " 


if she can get that threesome together , king will feel good about her chances against the spain 's formidable duo of arantxa sanchez vicario and conchita martinez . 


" to be a great coach you have to have the right horses and i got the right horses , " said king .

baseball - kevin brown lowers era as marlins beat reds . 


cincinnati 1996-08-31 


major league era leader kevin brown threw an eight-hitter and devon white 's rbi double snapped a fifth-inning tie as the florida marlins beat the cincinnati reds 3-1 for their seventh straight win friday . 


brown ( 14-10 ) tied todd stottlemyre of the cardinals for the national league lead with his fifth complete game and lowered his major league-leading earned run average from 1.96 to 1.92 . 


he struck out eight and did not walk a batter . 


brown threw 119 pitches and won for the third time in as many starts against the reds this season . 


" bolesy ( florida manager john boles ) told me yesterday , ' you have to go nine tomorrow , ' " brown said . 


" in the early innings , i was struggling , i was just trying to make it from pitch to pitch . 


i gave up a lot of hits in the early innings and i was n't thinking about the seventh , eighth or ninth . 


i was n't satisfied with any of my pitches and i did a better job of moving the ball around in the later innings . " 


" he has a devastating sinker , " observed reds manager ray knight . " 


the guys say it moved more than everyone in the league . 


i remember nolan ryan saying in ' 91 or ' 92 that he was the best young pitcher coming around in a long time and he saw ( tom ) seaver and ( jerry ) koosman when they were starting . " 


in philadelphia , delino deshields 's triple in the top of the 12th off jeff parrett ( 2-3 ) scored chad curtis and lifted the los angeles dodgers to a 7-6 victory over the phillies . 


los angeles won for the seventh time in eight games . 


darren dreifort ( 1-1 ) picked up the win after allowing a hit and a walk over 2 1/3 scoreless innings . 


todd worrell worked the 12th to earn his league-leading 37th save . 


the phillies have dropped five of their last six overall , and nine of 11 at home . 


billy ashley belted a three-run homer for los angeles . 


in chicago , the braves and cubs split a doubleheader . 


in the first game , ryne sandberg snapped an eighth-inning tie with an infield single and kevin foster ( 6-2 ) outdueled atlanta 's tom glavine ( 13-8 ) for his third straight win , 3-2 . 


foster , a .333 hitter , helped his own cause in the second with a two-run single . 


the braves took the second game when chipper jones singled home the tying run in the top of the ninth and andruw jones took advantage of a poor throw to score the go-ahead run on a sacrifice fly for a 6-5 victory . 


cubs shortstop jose hernandez committed three of chicago 's four errors . 


mike mordecai singled , doubled and homered for atlanta , which has won 14 of its last 19 games and has the best record in the majors , 84-50 . 


in montreal , scott sanders allowed one hit over eight innings and wally joyner hit a two-run single in a four-run third as the san diego padres blanked the expos 6-0 for their sixth straight win . 


sanders ( 8-4 ) struck out 10 and walked three to win his fourth straight . 


he allowed a leadoff double to david segui in the second , and won for the seventh time in eight decisions . 


the right-hander retired 14 batters in a row from the second inning through the seventh . 


mike oquist allowed one montreal hit in the ninth . 


montreal lost for the ninth time in 14 games . 


in new york , marvin benard 's two-run homer snapped a tie and shawn estes came one out away from his first complete game as the san francisco giants beat the mets 6-4 . 


benard , hitting .467 ( 14-for-30 ) against the mets this season , hit his first pitch from pete harnisch ( 8-10 ) in the seventh over the right-field fence to put the giants up 4-2 . 


estes ( 3-4 ) was lifted for closer rod beck after yielding a single with two out in the ninth . 


beck allowed a two-run double to alvaro espinoza , who collected a career-high four rbi , but struck out brent mayne for his 31st save . 


the loss was the mets ' eighth straight , their longest slide since september 1993 , and dropped them to 0-4 under new manager bobby valentine . 


in st louis , tom pagnozzi had three hits and three rbi and alan benes scattered six hits over six-plus innings as the cardinals beat the colorado rockies 7-4 . 


benes ( 12-8 ) allowed three runs , walked three and struck out three for the win . 


st louis defeated colorado for just the second time in 12 meetings dating back to last season .

eric anthony hit a pair of solo homers for the rockies .

tennis - edberg refuses to qo quietly . 


richard finn 


new york 1996-08-30 


refusing to go quietly in the night , stefan edberg extended his stay at his 14th and last u.s. open when bernd karbacher , trailing and hurting , quit in the fourth set of their second-round match friday . 


the 30-year-old edberg , a former two-time open champion , had wrestled control of the match away from karbacher when the german , hampered by a left hamstring injury , decided he could n't continue under the stadium lights at the national tennis centre . 


" a win is a win . 


i 'll take it , " edberg , who has announced that this will be his last grand slam event , said of the 3-6 6-3 6-3 1-0 victory . 


ironically , karbacher two years ago ended ivan lendl 's grand slam career here when the former champion had to retire in the middle of their first-round match . 


after seeing the trainer come out early in the third set , edberg was not surprised by karbacher 's decision not to go on . 


" i knew he had problems with something , " edberg said . " 


i really was n't surprised . " 


edberg had his own problems early in the match as the swede battled to acclimate himself to the nighttime conditions while karbacher was ripping passing shots and blasting serves past him . 


" i did n't really feel good to begin with , i had problems finding the timing on the ball , seeing the ball , " said edberg , who upset wimbledon champion and fifth-seeded richard krajicek in the first round . 


" this was one of these matches where i did n't play up to my standard . 


i had to fight hard . " 


edberg 's tenacity paid off in the second set . 


edberg lost his own serve twice , but he rallied for three breaks of his own , the last to wrap up the set . 


" that 's where the match sort of changed , " said edberg . " 


i think once i got that second set , i felt a lot better about my game . " 


edberg is starting to feel pretty good about postponing his swan song a lot longer . 


" it does n't look all that bad , " edberg said of his path through the draw starting next with a match against krajicek 's dutch countryman paul haarhuis . 


however , the 1991 and 1992 champion is not ready to start making plans to be in next week 's final . 


" i 'm always being realistic , " said edberg . " 


like i said many times , i think it 's a very little chance , but nothing is impossible . 


if i play great tennis , that could take me a long way . 


" a lot of things can happen , like tonight . "

steve pagani 


vienna 1996-08-31 


austria dominated their world cup group four qualifier against scotland on saturday with wave after wave of attacks but were unable to penetrate the visitors ' defence and had to settle for a goalless draw . 


scotland , who thrashed belarus 5-1 in their opening group four match , were unable to repeat their performance . 


austria 's best chance came in the 63rd minute with stephan marasek of sc freiburg taking advantage of a scramble in the scottish penalty area but his shot narrowly passing the left-hand post . 


they also went close a minute before the interval when a promising attack saw the ball fall to markus schopp but he hit his shot wide . 


everton 's duncan ferguson went close for scotland in the 65th minute when he forced austrian goalkeeper michael konsel to a diving save . 


two scotland players were shown yellow cards , captain gary mcallister for bringing down andreas heraf and ferguson for arguing against the referee 's decision . 


" the result is acceptable , " scottish coach craig brown told reporters . " 


we 'd hoped not to lose and we tried not to play for a draw but the austrian defence was simply too good . " 


sk rapid 's dietmar kuehbauer , who gave an impressive performance , said the team started off well but let the game slip after the first 30 minutes . 


" somehow it seemed there were less than 11 players on the pitch . 


we have lost two points . 


the scots are not really a great team and we should have won , " he said . 


austrian coach herbert prohaska said his team had displayed great fighting spirit but sometimes lacked ideas . 


teams : 


austria : michael konsel , markus schopp , peter schoettel , anton pfeffer , wolfgang feiersinger , stephan marasek , dieter ramusch ( andreas ogris 77th ) , dietmar kuehbauer , anton polster ( ( herfried sabitzer 68th ) , andreas herzog , andreas heraf .

soccer - france launch 1998 world cup build-up with 2-0 win . 


paris 1996-08-31 


euro 96 absentee nicolas ouedec and youri djorkaeff scored the goals as 1998 world cup hosts france beat mexico 2-0 in a friendly international on saturday . 


the victory extended to 29 matches france 's unbeaten run under coach aime jacquet , their euro 96 semifinal elimination having come in a penalty shoot-out , but was marred by the sending-off of chelsea central defender franck leboeuf . 


leboeuf was dismissed two minutes from time for a second bookable offence , fouling mexican substitute ricardo pelaez who minutes earlier had also been shown the yellow card for pushing the chelsea defender in the back . 


both goals came early in the second half after france had surprised the mexicans with three half-time substitutions . 


after a sterile first half , france injected more sting in midfield with the introduction of juventus 's zinedine zidane . 


this allowed djorkaeff to play further up and his cross from the right fell for ouedec , who has joined espanyol of barcelona from nantes since missing the european championship finals through injury , to score after a mistake by midfielder joaquin del olmo . 


within four minutes ouedec was returning the compliment for djorkaeff , playing a one-two with the internazionale milan forward down the middle to set him up for a cross shot past diving goalkeeper osvaldo sanchez . 


jacquet , beginning the 22-month countdown to france 's hosting of the world cup finals , said : " we have an identity ( as a team ) which we are going to work on . " 


teams : 


france - 1 - bernard lama ; 2 - lilian thuram ( 14 - sabri lamouchi 87th ) , 5 - laurent blanc , 8 - marcel desailly ( 12 - franck leboeuf 46th ) , 3 - bixente lizarazu ; 4 - christian karembeu , 7 - didier deschamps , 10 - youri djorkaeff , 6 - reynald pedros ( 13 - robert pires 46th ) ; 9 - nicolas ouedec ( 17 - florian maurice 64th ) , 11 - patrice loko ( 15 - zinedine zidane 46th )

soccer - belgium scrape past turkey despite crowd trouble . 


bert lauwers 


brussels 1996-08-31 


belgium kicked off their 1998 world cup campaign with a hard-fought 2-1 victory over 10-man turkey in a tense match marred by turkish crowd trouble shortly after the break . 


turkish fans , upset at their team 's 2-0 first-half deficit , ripped apart dozens of plastic seats and threw them over the fence . 


riot police took 10 minutes to restore order . 


the police were given an unexpected hand by second-half substitute sergen yalcin who rekindled turkish hopes in the 61st with a splendid half-volley which stunned belgian goalkeeper filip de wilde . 


but yalcin , who had come on just four minutes earlier , turned from hero to villain barely two minutes after his strike when he was sent off after spitting at an opponent and arguing with english referee david elleray . 


marc degryse had opened the scoring for belgium after 13 minutes , whacking a low 10-metre drive into the net after an incisive pass by defender dirk medved from the edge of the penalty area . 


brazilian-born luis oliveira then gleefully slipped the ball past goalkeeper rustu recber from the right of the area to make it 2-0 seven minutes before the interval , turkey 's best first-half effort proving to be a vicious 30-metre shot by ogun temizkanoglu which de wilde tipped over . 


the visitors , seeking to restore some pride after failing to score a single goal in euro 96 in june , repeatedly ripped through the left side of the home defence but de wilde was able to block several sharply-angled efforts . 


with only the group seven winners qualifying automatically for the 1998 finals in france , belgium could not afford a slip-up at home and they frantically chased a decisive third goal . 


but they were almost upset 12 minutes from time when de wilde fumbled a hard arif erdem shot and orhan cikirikci almost pounced on the loose ball . 


belgium 's best second-half effort came three minutes later when degryse put the ball over the bar from close range with recber beaten . 


teams : 


belgium - 1 - filip de wilde , 2 - bertrand crasson , 3 - dirk medved , 4 - pascal renier , 16 - geoffrey claeys , 6 - gunther schepens ( 15 - nico van kerckhoven , 81st ) , 10 - enzo scifo , 7 - gert verheyen ( 14 - frederic peiremans , 62nd ) , 9 - marc degryse , 8 - luc nilis , 11- luis oliveira ( 18 - gilles de bilde , 88th ) . 


turkey - 1 - rustu recber , 4 - hakan unsal ( 14 - sergen yalcin , 57th ) , 2 - recep cetin , 3 - ogun temizkanoglu , 5 - alpay ozalan , 7- abdullah ercan , 6 - tolunay kafkas , 10 - oguz cetin ( 13 - arif erdem , 57th ) , 11 - tayfun korkut , 9 - hakan sukur , 8 - saffet sancakli ( 17- orhan cikirikci , 76th ) . 


belgian coach wilfried van moer said he had not expected turkey to be so strong and fast . 


" we started panicking a bit after the turkish goal ... 


we suffered , " said van moer , who succeeded paul van himst as coach in april . 


it was belgium 's first victory under van moer after two draws in friendlies against russia and italy .

dublin 1996-08-31 


a powerful right hook followed by a straight left gave defending champion nate miller a seventh round knock-out win over fellow american james heath in their wba cruiserweight title bout on saturday . 


miller , who went into the contest with a record of 24 knock-out wins in 32 fights , took charge from the opening bell and had his opponent on the canvas inside 90 seconds when he landed a deft left-hook to the head . 


heath did score with two brusing lefts to miller 's head in the third round but failed to put his opponent under any real pressure . 


miller raised the pace of the contest at the start of the fifth round and , once he started to get his right-left combinations working for him , the fight was never likely to go the distance .

paper says thatcher 's office consulted astrologer . 


london 1996-09-01 


a british newspaper said margaret thatcher was so shaken by an ira attempt on her life when she was prime minister in 1984 that an astrologer was asked to warn her against future threats . 


the sunday telegraph quoted majorie orr as saying she did a horoscope chart for thatcher , a libran , after she narrowly escaped death in the irish guerrilla bombing of a hotel during the conservative party conference more than a decade ago . 


orr said thatcher 's press secretary bernard ingram asked her to telephone if she saw any threatening indications in the future . 


" bernard ingham told me that if i ever heard anything that indicated danger i was to let him know , " orr said . 


orr said she never had to telephone . 


she added that the horoscope was purely for security purposes and she was never consulted about political moves . 


ingram was quoted as telling the newspaper he thought astrology was " a load of rubbish " and that he could not recall asking orr to keep a watch on thatcher 's stars . 


thatcher , dubbed the " iron lady " for her driven , forceful personality , was never known to have an interest in the occult and in fact has a university degree in chemistry . 


former u.s. president ronald reagan 's wife , nancy , admitted in her biography my turn that she regularly consulted an astrologer to help her plan her husband 's schedule .

scottish labour party narrowly backs referendum . 


stirling , scotland 1996-08-31 


british labour party leader tony blair won a narrow victory on saturday when the party 's scottish executive voted 21-18 in favour of his plans for a referendum on a separate parliament for scotland . 


blair once pledged to set up a scottish parliament if the labour won the next general election , which must be held by may 1997 . 


but many activists were dismayed when he abruptly decided earlier this year to hold a two-question referendum on the issue , asking scots if they wanted a separate parliament and if it should have tax-raising powers . 


many party members argued that a general election win would demonstrate popular support for a separate parliament and others said a single question referendum would suffice . 


prime minister john major says the 300-year-old union of the scottish and english parliaments will be a main plank in his conservative party 's election platform . 


conservatives have only 10 of the 72 scottish seats in parliament and consistently run third in opinion polls in scotland behind labour and the independence-seeking scottish national party .

britain on saturday condemned iraqi involvement in an attack on the kurdish city of arbil and said it was in close touch with its allies . 


" we condemn iraqi involvement . 


in no way can iraqi involvement be seen as helpful , " said a foreign office spokesman . 


u.n. officials said that a kurdish rebel faction backed up by iraqi tanks , heavy artillery and helicopters had taken control of half of the city after heavy fighting . 


arbil lies within the so-called safe haven set up at the end of the 1991 gulf war on the suggestion of british prime minister john major to protect iraqi kurds from attack by the iraqi military . 


the area is patrolled by u.s. , french and british planes .

seven iraqi men appeared in court on saturday charged with air piracy following the hijacking to britain of a sudanese airliner with 199 people aboard . 


the seven , including a carpenter and a businessmen and whose ages ranged from 25 to 38 years old , were ordered to be held in jail until another hearing next week . 


no pleas were entered at the preliminary hearing . 


they were accused of taking over flight 150 which was flying from khartoum , sudan , to amman , jordan . 


all the hostages were freed on tuesday after the plane landed at stansted airport , north of london . 


the men have claimed political asylum in britain saying they were persecuted while in iraq . 


their court appearance means they will face trial and possible imprisonment in britain before their applications for asylum are considered . 


under english law the maximum sentence for hijack is life imprisonment but there has been widespread speculation that the seven will receive lesser sentences . 


after a search of the aircraft following the hijack , police found only knives and fake explosives .

s. african afrikaners still seek own territory . 


cape town 1996-08-31 


south african right-wing afrikaners on saturday revived their campaign for a form of self-rule , identifying a sparsely-populated area in northern cape province as the best place for a home of their own . 


constand viljoen , leader of the freedom front party , told a news conference in pretoria self-determination for afrikaners could begin at local government level . 


" certain powers can be delegated from the provincial level , towards the sub-regions , " he said . 


" we think that the afrikaner model within this new , multi- ethnic society of south africa will have to develop experimentally with world thinking in this regard . " 


viljoen broke with other right-wing whites in 1994 by taking part in the country 's first all-race elections in april of that year , saying the only way to attain self-determination was by cooperating with president nelson mandela 's majority african national congress . 


some right-wingers demanded sovereignty in their own territory in the run-up to the elections , saying the alternative was war . 


their threats came to nothing . 


viljoen has hailed clauses in south africa 's new constitution as making possible a form of self-rule for the afrikaners , descendants of the country 's dutch , german and french settlers . 


according to state television , viljoen told the news conference the self-rule model should be introduced in parts of the northern cape provinces where a majority of people -- whites and mixed-race coloureds -- speak afrikaans .

rwandan refugee group calls for calm over census . 


nairobi 1996-08-31 


a rwandan refugee lobby group called on saturday for calm in refugee camps in eastern zaire during a census from sunday to be conducted by aid workers . 


the rally for the return of refugees and democracy in rwanda ( rdr ) urged the u.n. high commissioner for refugees to avoid any " policing approach " and to calm refugees by explaining the aims of the operation . 


" the rdr appeals to all refugees to prepare themselves calmly for the demands of the census agents because it will be in their ultimate interest , " the group said in a statement . 


it said refugees feared census takers would use indelible ink to mark them so they could be detected by rwandan government troops and mistreated if they were forced back into rwanda . 


u.n. officials said more than 1,000 aid workers will take part in the census from sunday until tuesday of the estimated 727,000 refugees in camps around the eastern zairean border town of goma . 


only about 100 refugees a week are returning voluntarily to rwanda in contrast to the 600 babies born in the camps weekly . 


zairean prime minister kengo wa dondo said at the end of a visit to rwanda last week that the zairean and rwandan governments agreed on an " organised , massive and unconditional repatriation " of the 1.1 million rwandan refugees in zaire . 


he said the repatriation would be carried out swiftly and would be enormous , starting with the closure of refugee camps . 


rdr said it feared forced expulsions would start in days . 


zairean troops expelled 15,000 refugees in august last year . 


many of the 1.1 million rwandan hutu refugees in zaire and nearly 600,000 in tanzania refuse to go home , saying they fear reprisals for the 1994 genocide in rwanda of up to a million people by hutus .

nato monitors moslem move towards tense village . 


mahala , bosnia 1996-08-31 


nato said it was closely monitoring the movement of about 75 moslem men towards the village of mahala in bosnia 's serb republic on saturday , two days after a violent confrontation with serbs . 


" i have to report this morning that we have in fact received reports ... 


that up to 75 moslem men are believed to be approaching mahala , " nato spokesman lieutenant-colonel max marriner said in sarajevo . 


marriner said that nato troops had set up a checkpoint on the road between tuzla and mahala to establish the identities and intentions of the men headed towards the village . 


mahala is a moslem village on bosnian serb republic territory . 


moslems were driven from the village during the 43- month bosnian war and most of their houses were destroyed . 


some moslems began returning to rebuild their properties earlier in the week . 


fights and shooting broke out between the moslems and serb police on thursday and nato troops finally brought restored order . 


a reuters reporter who entered mahala on saturday morning found it tranquil but nato troops and u.n. police were seen on the ground and nato helicopters flew overhead .

chechens exuberant but cautious on peace deal . 


liutauras stremaitis 


urus-martan , russia 1996-08-31 


crowds of pro-independence chechens greeted a newly-signed peace deal by singing , dancing and firing guns in the air on saturday , but the celebrations held a trace of uncertainty . 


more than a thousand women , children and men gathered in a field to the north of the town of urus-martan on saturday to wait for a column of rebels to withdraw from the capital grozny about 25 km ( 12 miles ) away . 


the men fired weapons into the air as groups of women danced . 


adults in the crowd carried posters of former chechen leader dzhokhar dudayev -- who declared independence in 1991 -- and children , carrying photographs of him , called " troops out ! " 


. 


russian military officials have expressed fears that the rebels and their supporters will see the deal signed by russian peace envoy alexander lebed in the early hours of saturday as a military victory for the separatists . 


it involves the withdrawal of russian troops sent to chechnya in december 1994 to crush the separatists and a postponement of the issue at the heart of the conflict -- the status of the mainly-moslem north caucasus region . 


but the people in the crowd on saturday , who had turned out in support of the rebels , did not seem sure that the war was over . 


" we hope for the best , that it really has ended so we can live in peace . 


it 's our only dream , " said a 30-year-old woman , mubatik dagayeva . 


aiza dudayeva , with her 10-year-old son beside her , shared the guarded optimism . " 


we really want the war to end , we hope and believe that our sons and brothers will win , " said dudayeva , adding that she was from urus-martan . 


urus-martan is a traditionally anti-separatist pocket in chechnya and moscow-backed leader doku zavgayev , who has been sidelined in the peace deal , has warned that it and places like it could become centres of civil war if russian troops leave . 


but on saturday the people gathered just outside the town seemed to be united in favour of the separatists . 


two columns of rebels appeared in jeeps and cars , firing their guns in the air , as the crowd rushed towards them . 


mouldi mamatuyev , in his late 20 's , dressed in black and carrying a machine gun , was welcomed by his mother and sister . 


" two sons have come back , " said his mother nurbika mamatuyeva . " 


it 's the end . 


we believe in god . " 


mamatuyev joked that his sister lisa was a rebel too , and she responded by grabbing hold of his gun and shouting the chechen war cry " allahu akhbar " ( god is greatest ) and " freedom for chechnya ! " 


. 


the fighter , sitting next to a man dressed in green and carrying a grenade-launcher , said that the strict islamic law adopted by the rebels during the conflict was now needed to impose peace . 


" the war has ended if everything works out , if there is law there will be power . 


only sheriat ( islamic law ) can end the war . "

polish group to bid for ruch newsstand chain - paper . 


warsaw 1996-08-31 


a polish consortium including the bank rozwoju exportu sa ( bre ) plans to rival france 's hachette in bidding for polish state-owned press distribution chain ruch sa , zycie warszawy daily said on saturday . 


zycie warszawy said its own publisher , mineral water firm multico , and a group headed by polish businessman zygmunt solorz were forming a consortium which would offer about $ 120 million , with finance provided by bre . 


the consortium wanted 40 percent of ruch 's shares , the state would get 20 percent of ruch and 40 percent would be offered on the warsaw stock exchange . 


" this division would guarantee a dispersal of capital , preventing anyone from taking total control over ruch and dictating market conditions , " the paper quoted one of the initiators of the move as saying , without giving a name . 


a consortium of press distributor hachette and polish publishers group uwp are seeking more than than 50 percent of ruch and french president jacques chirac is likely to support its case when he visits poland in september , the daily said . 


news-stand chain ruch , which controls about 65 percent of poland 's press distribution market , had a net profit of 16.2 million zlotys on sales of 2.7 billion zlotys in 1995 . 


it has about 17,000 news-stands and was the country 's sole press distributor before the 1989 fall of communism . 


zycie warszawy said the new , open consortium , which also included several listed polish firms , would on monday inform privatisation minister wieslaw kaczmarek of its plans . 


it aims to invest $ 200 million in ruch over five years -- more than the sum ruch says it needs to upgrade its outlets . 


initially poland offered up to 75 percent of ruch but in march kaczmarek cancelled the tender and offered a minority stake with an option to increase the equity . 


two consortia -- uwp-hachette and a consortium of a polish spc group and swiss firms -- placed initial bids . 


but after the change of tender conditions swiss investors pulled out and spc decided to bid jointly with uwp-hachette . 


kaczmarek said in may he was unhappy that only one investor ended up bidding for ruch , in which the government was initially offering up to 35 percent of shares with an option to extend the holding after investment promises are fulfilled .

china said to fear dissidents more than criminals . 


manila 1996-08-31 


the detention of veteran dissident wang donghai showed china 's determination to crush any vestige of dissent during the current profound transitions in the nation 's leadership , a human rights activist said on saturday . 


xiao qiang , executive director of the new york-based group human rights in china , said wang 's arrest on friday appeared to be part of the national " strike hard " campaign that has imprisoned thousands and sent hundreds to their death . 


although supposedly aimed at criminals , dozens of human rights activists have been detained in the campaign , which is meant to strengthen the communist party 's grip on power as senior leader deng xiaoping nears death , xiao said in an interview . 


" china is going through this power transition period . 


the authorities are apparently extremely afraid of any political and social discontent , " said xiao , in manila to attend an amnesty international conference on human rights in china . 


he said one of wang 's apparent offences was to write a public letter in may suggesting that a free press and an independent judicial system were vital if the government really meant to stamp out rampant corruption . 


xiao said crushing legitimate dissent was only making the problem worse and one day china would pay a high price . 


" those issues are not going to go away by repression . 


you only make things more hidden but potentially more explosive , " he said . 


wang was arrested in the east china city of hangzhou by security officers who told the dissident 's family he would be sent to a study class -- a euphemism for coercive ideological reform . 


wang , 45 , was sentenced last month to one year 's " re-education by labour " but was released because of ill-health . 


xiao said conditions in the labour camp were so brutal they drove another activist sentenced with wang to attempt suicide . 


police beat wang and his colleague , chen longde , and encouraged other camp inmates to attack them as well , xiao said .

burma 's suu kyi says military rulers abuse law . 


deborah charles 


rangoon 1996-08-31 


burma 's democracy leader aung san suu kyi hit out at the government on saturday for recent arrests and jailing of activists , saying the military abused the law to try to crush the democracy movement . 


" the main purpose of this press conference is to make it known to the world that the authorities are misusing the law all the time in order to try to crush the democracy movement , " suu kyi told reporters at her rangoon home . 


suu kyi said at least 61 democracy supporters had been arrested since may , and about 30 of them had been sentenced , most to long prison terms . 


in may the government launched a sweeping crackdown on the democracy movement , detaining over 260 members of suu kyi 's national league for democracy ( nld ) ahead of a party congress . 


most were released but several dozen remain in custody . 


the burmese government last week confirmed the recent sentencing of nine democracy activists who were arrested in the may crackdown , including suu kyi 's assistant win htein . 


the military government , which in may said it had detained the politicians to prevent anarchy , said the activists were charged with attempting to destroy the peace and stability of the state . 


but suu kyi disagreed with the methods , saying officials often arrested nld supporters in the middle of the night , then did not give them the opportunity to defend themselves in trials . 


" when our people are tried , they are tried in a very secretive way . 


their families are not told , " she said . 


suu kyi , who spearheads a campaign for sanctions on burma 's government , was under house arrest for six years without being tried before being released in july 1995 . 


several other leading members of the nld have served prison terms . 


the nld party won a landslide victory in a 1990 election but the state law and order restoration council ( slorc ) , which assumed power in 1988 after crushing pro-democracy demonstrations , never recognised the poll . 


" this lack of rule of law is an indication that the authorities are not interested in fair play , " she said . " 


they are using a travesty of the law to try and crush our movements and to sentence our people to long terms in prison without proper trial . " 


suu kyi said once the activists were sentenced , they suffered inhuman conditions and lack of rights in prison . 


" almost all of the prisoners start suffering from various health problems after a couple of years in jail , " she said . " 


some of our people have been in prison for five to six years . " 


most political prisoners are held in rangoon 's insein prison . 


some who have been released have recounted torture methods like sleep and food deprivation and physical abuse . 


" if there are any more instances of death in custody it will be further proof that a prison sentence for political prisoners is sometimes almost the same as a death sentence , " suu kyi said . 


hla than , an elected member of parliament for the nld , died in early august after being at insein for six years . 


his death came five weeks after james leander ( leo ) nichols , a close friend of suu kyi and danish honorary consul , died while serving a prison term at insein . 


suu kyi said the government had increased its repression tactics on the democracy movement because it feared the growing popularity of the movement . 


but she said she and the nld would not stop their efforts to bring democracy to burma even if it meant more arrests of party members or even herself . 


" we will carry on . 


nobody is free from arrest in burma . "

seoul 1996-08-31 


north korea demanded on saturday that south korea return a northern war veteran who has been in the south since the 1950-53 war , seoul 's unification ministry said . 


" ...i request the immediate repatriation of kim in-so to north korea where his family is waiting , " north korean red cross president li song-ho said in a telephone message to his southern couterpart , kang young-hoon . 


li said kim had been critically ill with a cerebral haemorrhage . 


the message was distributed to the press by the south korean unification ministry . 


kim , an unrepentant communist , was captured during the korean war and released after spending more than 30 years in a southern jail . 


he submitted a petition to the international red cross in 1993 asking for his repatriation . 


the domestic yonhap news agency said the south korean government would consider the northern demand only if the north accepted seoul 's requests , which include regular reunions of families split by the korean war . 


government officials were not available to comment . 


south korea in 1993 unconditionally repatriated li in-mo , a nothern partisan seized by the south during the war and jailed for more than three decades .

chinese police have detained veteran dissident wang donghai , the new york-based pressure group human rights in china said on saturday . 


police in hangzhou , capital of the eastern province of zhejiang , told wang 's family that wang would be sent to a study class , a euphemism for coercive ideological reform , the group said . 


police gave no reason for detaining wang on friday and would not let his family meet him or say where he was being held , the group said . 


police also would not say why wang was being sent to a study class -- a holdover from the chaotic 1966-76 cultural revolution -- or say when he would be released , the group said . 


wang 's family and hangzhou police could not be reached for immediate comment . 


the group demanded wang 's release and said his detention was a dangerous signal china was returning to its cultural revolution days . 


last month , wang , 45 , a veteran dissident of the 1979 democracy wall movement , was ordered to serve one year of " re-education through labour " , but released because of poor health . 


re-education through labour is an administrative punishment with a maximum of three years that can be imposed by police without recourse to prosecutors or the courts . 


wang was jailed for two years for organising street protests after the military crushed pro-democracy demonstrations by students at beijing 's tiananmen square on june 4 , 1989 , with heavy loss of life . 


chinese authorities appeared to be using administrative punishment more frequently to take dissidents out of circulation without having to go through a more complicated judicial process to impose criminal sentences , western diplomats have said .

automakers , u.s. agency plan air bag safety ads . 


detroit 1996-08-31 


automakers , suppliers , insurers and the federal government 's auto safety agency saturday launched a $ 10 million safety awareness campaign aimed at reducing the number of children killed accidentally by air bags in cars and trucks . 


officials said they will work with law enforcement agencies , pediatricians and media to warn parents about the dangers that air bags pose to children and adults not wearing seatbelts . 


since 1993 , 24 children have been killed by the explosive force of automotive air bags , which inflate at speeds up to 200 miles per hour . 


the first portion of the campaign involves pickup trucks equipped with billboards that were driving along some of the nation 's busiest interstate highways during the labor day weekend , including interstate 95 on the east coast , interstates 80 and 90 in the midwest and interstate 5 in california . 


the boards read : " air bag safety : everyone buckled , kids in back . " 


janet dewey , executive director of the industry-funded national automobile occupant protection campaign , said most of the injuries to children occurred because they were not wearing seatbelts . 


a child 's chances of being killed in a car accident , whether the vehicle was equipped with an air bag or not , is reduced by 29 percent when they are in the rear seat , she said . 


the auto industry was about three to six years away from introducing " smart " air bags with the ability to detect the size and position of an occupant and adjust inflation pressures accordingly . 


current air bags were designed to halt the forward momentum of an average-sized , unbelted adult male , not a small child . 


automakers petitioned the national highway traffic safety administration to allow them to introduce air bags that inflate less aggressively to help reduce unwanted injuries . 


" even if changes are made to airbags today , we 'd still have 20 million vehicles on the road with current technology , " dewey said . " 


the public has n't been getting the message . "

more than 300 u.s. warplanes and 20 ships were available on saturday in case president bill clinton ordered the use of u.s. force against iraqi military action in northern iraq , u.s. defense officials said . 


they said 200 fighter planes , including 79 on the aircraft carrier carl vinson , were already in the gulf ; the aircraft carrier enterprise was in the eastern mediterranean with 79 more , and an air expeditionary force with up to 40 more was ready to fly from the united states if ordered . 


" yesterday the president ordered the department of defense to take prudent planning steps to have forces ready to deploy to the region should he direct us to do so , " pentagon spokesman doug kennett said . " 


we have taken those prudent planning steps . " 


clinton said on saturday he had ordered u.s. forces in the gulf to go on high alert and was reinforcing them in response to iraqi attacks on kurdish dissidents in northern iraq . 


" these developments ... cause me grave concern , " clinton said at a campaign stop in troy , tennessee . 


but he added , " it is premature at this time , and i want to emphasize that , highly premature to speculate on any response we might have . " 


the u.s. defense officials said military flights to enforce no-fly zones in both northern and southern iraq doubled over the weekend . 


clinton said iraqi military forces overran the city of arbil , which has been held since 1994 by kurdish rebels who baghdad says are backed by iran . 


there were unconfirmed reports that iran had sent troops into northern iraq in response to iraq 's attack . 


u.s. plans rely heavily on u.s. air attacks on iraqi forces , but there are also 23,000 u.s. troops in the region , according to defense officials . 


in addition to the 158 f / a-18 , f-14 and other fighter planes on the aircraft carriers vinson and enterprise , the air force air expeditionary force of 30 to 40 f-15 and f-16 fighter planes and fuel tankers is ready to fly from three u.s. bases in the united states , they said . 


the expeditionary force would include nearly 1,000 air force personnel in ground and support crews , they said .

algerian newspapers quoted the human rights national observatory ( ondh ) , a government-appointed watchdog , as saying earlier in august that about 1,400 civilians had been killed in bomb attacks blamed on moslem guerrillas in the past two years . 


an estimated 50,000 people have died in algeria 's violence pitting moslem rebels against government forces since early 1992 when the authorities cancelled a general election in which radical islamists had taken a commanding lead .

iran agents stormed german diplomat 's home -- bonn . 


bonn 1996-08-31 


iranian security forces burst into the home of a german cultural attache in tehran a month ago and seized his guests for questioning , bonn 's foreign ministry said on saturday . 


a spokesman said he could substantially confirm a report in the news weekly der spiegel , which said iranian secret police burst in while attache jens gust was entertaining six iranian writers and their wives . 


gust was threatened with violence , then locked into a room to be interrogated on suspicion of " promoting activities hostile to the state " while his guests were taken away , the magazine said . 


the ministry spokesman said the german embassy immediately made a sharp protest to the tehran government . 


the iranian ambassador was also summoned to the ministry in bonn to hear a sharp protest and " disapproval of this glaring breach of the principles of international law " , he added . 


iran subsequently said it regretted the incident , which it said had been the result of a misunderstanding . 


all those detained appeared to have been freed , the spokesman said . 


relations between the two countries are currently under strain because of the testimony in a berlin court of former iranian president abolhassan banisadr . 


banisadr , an avowed opponent of the tehran government who now lives in exile , accused top iranian leaders of personally ordering the assassination of three exiled kurdish leaders in a berlin restaurant in 1992 . 


iran has asked germany to extradite banisadr , who is due is due back in berlin next thursday to continue his testimony . 


banisadr , who received political asylum in france after fleeing there in 1981 , told der spiegel he did not plan to ask for a guarantee of safe conduct . 


if germany were to extradite him , he said , it would " lose face before the whole world " . 


german prosecutors have already accused iran 's intelligence minister ali fallahiyan of ordering the killing of the kurdish leaders . 


iran , which denies the allegations , urged german authorities to disregard banisadr 's testimony and said it could hurt relations .

controversial ira film screened at venice festival . 


vera haller 


venice , italy 1996-08-31 


dublin-born director neil jordan says he never lost more sleep over a film than over " michael collins " , his controversial epic about the ira which has its premiere on saturday at the venice film festival . 


the film , starring liam neeson and julia roberts , recounts the life of michael collins , the irish republican army 's director of intelligence who fought for irish independence from 1919 to 1921 . 


although not due for release in britain until early next year , some politicians have already said they feared it would fan sectarian tensions in british-ruled northern ireland . 


jordan defends his decision to make the film , whose screenplay he wrote himself after years of research , saying it was " more about history than any political statement " . 


" the film spares neither the irish nor the british in its depiction of the savagery of the time , " jordan said in a statement released by warner bros . " 


how often has independence been achieved without bloodshed ? 


very rarely . " 


jordan , whose 1992 film " the crying game " also came under fire for what was perceived as a sympathetic portrayal of the ira , said collins was more than just a revolutionary . 


" he developed techniques of guerilla warfare later copied by independence movements around the world , from mao tse-tung in china to yitzak shamir in israel , " jordan said . 


" collins would never be a proponent of contemporary terrorism as practised today . 


he was a soldier and a statesman and , over time , a man of peace . " 


leeson , the northern ireland-born actor who was nominated for an oscar for best actor for his performance in " schindler 's list " , plays the lead role in jordan 's film . 


aidan quinn portrays harry boland , collins ' best friend , and rival for the love of kitty kiernan , played by roberts . 


much of the film was shot on location in dublin with jordan using thousands of its citizens as unpaid extras . 


a set , however , was used for the fighting scenes . 


noting that information about collins was " as mysterious as the existence he maintained " , jordan said he made some historical assumptions in the film . 


" i have made choices about certain events based on my own extensive research into his letters and reported speeches , " he said . " 


i wanted to make this a story as accurate as possible without killing it dramatically and i think i have . 


it is a very true film . " 


one of the assumptions is his interpretation of the murky circumstances surrounding the shooting death of collins , who had broken with his comrades when he sought a negotiated settlement with britain , in an ambush in 1922 . 


" i have never lost more sleep over the making of a film than i have over ' michael collins ' , but i 'll never make a more important one , " jordan said . 


" in the life of one person you can tell the events that formed the north and south of ireland as they are today . "
