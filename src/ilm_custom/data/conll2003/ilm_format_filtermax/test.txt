" ( albright ) is a convinced advocate of nato enlargement and of stabilisation of security structures . " 


czech ambassador to the united nations , karel kovanda , told the daily mlada fronta dnes that albright " is a little light in our diplomatic heaven , " but warned against expecting her to exert any influence in favour of the czechs .

saturday 's national congress of the ruling czech civic democratic party ( ods ) will discuss making the party more efficient and transparent , foreign minister and ods vice-chairman josef zieleniec , said on friday . 


" modernisation and more profesionalism of the party 's structure , having financing of the party be more transparent ... 


zieleniec in the summer led calls for the party and its leadership to listen to more diverse opinions , a thinly-veiled criticism of klaus who has spearheaded the country 's post-communist economic reforms . 


but after the first round vote a week before , the ods had the potential to win as many 79 seats . 


klaus and his coalition lost its majority in parliament in june lower house elections after the left-wing opposition consolidated , putting the centre-left social democrats in a strong second-place position . 


rosati did not say whether the payment in 1970s was part of the 1949 agreement between warsaw and switzerland on compensation to swiss citizens whose assets were seized by the soviet-imposed communists authorities after world war two . 


" i expect that the commission will finish gathering information within two to three weeks and then more details will be provided , " rosati said . 


rosati confirmed that the 1949 agreement had provided for granting switzerland about 53 million francs and most of this sum was repaid with coal exports . 


" about 16,000 francs were seized from accounts of four or five polish citizens , whose data we do not precisely know . 


the issue is of moral and legal nature , because its financial significance is small , " rosati said . 


the conservative radical democrats ( fdp ) have said they would ask parliament next week to order swiss banks to put some 40 million swiss francs ( $ 31 million ) in dormant wealth into a fund earmarked for jewish groups and charitable organisations .

polish brewer zywiec 's 1996 profit slump may last into next year due in part to hefty depreciation charges , but recent high investment should help the firm defend its 10-percent market share , the firm 's chief executive said . 


van boxmeer would not say how much higher 1997 profits or market share could be but said sales of leading polish brewers should rise as the country 's young urban professionals gradually switch from vodka to beer . 


" the perspective on growth is such that reasonably we can think that somewhere between 65 and 80 litres per year is certainly reachable , " van boxmeer said on polish per-capita beer consumption , currently around 40 litres . 


he said the 65-80-litre level could be reached in the next ten years and make poland , with its 40-million population , europe 's third largest beer market after germany and britain . 


earlier this year south african breweries ltd ( sab ) bought strategic stakes in the unlisted lech and tychy brewers , which together hold more than 20 percent of the market , and australia 's brewpole bv has a controlling stake in poland 's larges t brewery , elbrewery company ltd. ( eb ) . 


but he said the company 's investment of more than $ 100 million already this decade , largely in production , would help position it to compete with such competitors as brewers from the neighbouring czech republic . 


some analysts say cheaper but high-quality czech imports could invade poland once tariffs for cefta countries are lifted in 1998 , but van boxmeer says such a threat might be exaggerated despite the czech beer market 's overcapacity . 


" i think polish consumers in general are quite proud of their beers -- and i 'm speaking about all the brands -- and as we make good beers ... 


van boxmeer said zywiec had its eye on okocim , which has said it would start producing carlsberg beer next year , but that zywiec 's potential production of heineken was a medium-term possibility rather than a short-term one . 


he said his firm would be better off concentrating on its leading brand , zywiec full light , which accounts for 85 percent of sales and is the country 's largest-selling brand . 


van boxmeer also said zywiec would be boosted by its recent shedding of soft drinks which only accounted for about three percent of the firm 's overall sales and for which 7.6 million zlotys in provisions had already been made . 


he said that the procedure to insert a device into havel 's throat , done after his breathing worsened on thursday , had helped , and the president 's condition significantly improved .

havel has been recovering from surgery on monday which removed a small malignant tumour and half of his right lung .

the british government warned friday that it would refer the proposed trans-atlantic alliance between british airways plc and american airlines to britain 's monopolies and mergers commission unless the carriers complied with a number of conditions . 


trade and industry secretary ian lang added that even if the conditions were met by both airlines , final clearance would hinge on an open skies deal between britain and the united states to liberalise trans-atlantic air traffic , which would create greater competition on the routes . 


" i agree ... that without suitable undertakings the alliance would be likely to lead to a significant loss of actual and potential passengers , on those routes where ba and aa currently compete and for all passengers on the trans-atlantic market route between the uk and u.s. , " he said . 


industry sources said there was no new date for fresh talks and blamed the deadlock on uncertainty over whether the british airways-american deal would be cleared . 


the conditions for clearance of the alliance were that british airways and american drop 168 slots at london heathrow airport , the busiest in europe . 


british airways 's initial response was that " unconditional divestiture of slots is unprecedented and if done it must be on the basis of fair market value . " 


the government also wants british airways to drop a clause in its agreement with usair that bars it from competing on trans-atlantic routes , and said both british airways and american should be prepared to reduce services on the london to dallas-fort worth route in the event that a new entrant wishes to enter .

wall street , since the bid , has speculated that any deal between newmont and santa fe would be a " bear hug , " or a reluctantly negotiated agreement where the buyer is not necessarily a friendly suitor . 


analysts predict santa fe will go to the highest bidder , and that if a rival buyer is found , newmont may not be able to match its offer . 


any deal , friendly or hostile , would almost assuredly be a stock swap , which is necessary to preserve the tax-free , pooling-of-interest accounting , they said . 


analysts and arbitrageurs immediately ruled out barrick gold corp and bre-x minerals ltd as santa fe saviors because they are locked in negotiations over their splitting indonesia 's busang vast gold deposit . 


placer dome inc too was considered unlikley because it is focusing on geographic expansion in areas that do match santa fe 's nevada , south america and central asia presence , they said .

" i think homestake could come in as a white knight , but how much is someone willing to come in above the newmont number .

if he decided it was necessary and safe for the aircrew , he would not hesitate to order airdrops of food for the refugees , even against the wishes of the government in kinshasa and the zairean rebels who control much of eastern zaire , he said . 


" tomorrow i 'm going into rwanda and my intention is to go across into eastern zaire and try to find out for the second time what the situation is on the ground , " he said . 


general baril saw rebel leader laurent kabila in goma last week but the rebels told him the crisis was over because most of the rwandan refugees have already gone home . 


kinshasa opposes airdrops , apparently because the food could fall into the hands of the rebels and their local supporters . 


canadian defence minister doug young said on thursday that the multinational force would probably not have to make food airdrops or intervene militarily in any major way . 


" it does n't look as though they ( airdrops ) are going to be required in any significant way because the ngos ( non-governmental organisations ) are in that area on the border between zaire and rwanda , " young told reporters . 


but general baril said it would be premature to rule out any course of action until he had more information . 


" we hope that if the front moves forward or stabilises then we will have access ( to the large group of refugees ) with reconnaissance or humanitarian agencies . 


" if they ca n't move because they are too weak , then we will probably consider very seriously using air delivery means ( airdrops ) ...it 's complex , it 's dangerous for the air crew that fly in there and it will have to be absolutely necessary . 


do you think that i would have a conscience problem doing it or not at that time ? 


and my mandate is also under chapter seven to operate in eastern zaire . " 


under chapter seven of the u.n. charter , the security council has wide powers to preserve peace and security . 


" i know their ( the zairean government 's ) position and i know it 's very delicate and we are very sensitive to their position also , " the general added . 


i coordinate with those who are holding ground and that 's a wise thing to do . 


baril said that apart from the group of 150,000 , u.s. and british reconnaissance plans had tracked two much smaller groups of refugees -- one of up to 1,000 north of the town of masisi and one of up to 8,000 on the road from bukavu west to kindu .

a former cabinet minister in central african republic and his son were abducted from their home and murdered in growing ethnic violence in the capital bangui , a government minister said on friday . 


with violence spiralling out of control , france voiced backing for the elected bangui government but said its troops based in the former colony under defence pacts would not help it combat army mutineers . 


" french troops may only take part in maintaining order to avoid major abuses and protect foreign communities , " he said . 


public service minister david dofara , who is the head of the national red cross , told reuters he had seen the bodies of former interior minister christophe grelombe and his son , who was not named . 


the uprising began over pay demands but has turned into a campaign to topple patasse , sparking ethnic violence and dividing the capital . 


the former minister and his son had been taken from their home close to the presidential palace , which is guarded by loyalist soldiers backed by french troops based in bangui . 


the bodies were found on thursday in an open field about two km ( one mile ) further away , said dofora and other witnesses . 


the men were seized as loyalist forces and french troops fought gunbattles with mutineers who fired rockets into the city centre . 


shops and businesses have remained shut this week . 


the franco-african summit decided to send a mission bangui to seek ways of containing the mutiny and a threat of civil war . 


chirac said burkina faso president blaise compaore would visit bangui " in the coming hours " with the heads of state of gabon , mali and chad to try and establish dialogue between authorities and rebels . 


soldiers staged mutinies in april and may , with french troops stepping in with tanks and helicopters to quell the more serious second uprising . 


patasse offered concessions and amnesty to rebels before the may rebellion ended after rebels looted the city centre . 


rebels accuse patasse of tribalism and of arming his civilian supporters and hired guns from sudan and chad . 


mutineers have vowed to disarm all civilians and to chase out the foreign forces knwon as codos . 


hospital sources and witnesses said about 10 people were known to have been killed in the more than two weeks of fighting , including two rebels killed in thursday 's clashes .

poland 's ex-communist president aleksander kwasniewski is likely to visit polish-born pope john paul in early 1997 despite uneasy relations between the vatican and warsaw , the foreign minister said on friday . 


rosati said that the atmosphere of the meeting , if it takes place , would largely depend on the progress in talks on ratification of a treaty between warsaw and the vatican . 


the ratification of the treaty , which was signed in 1993 by the then right-centrist government , is being delayed by an ex-communist party , which won parliamentary elections in the same year and now dominates parliament . 


the party , the democratic left alliance , says the agreement would give the catholic church too much influence over life in poland and could infringe on rights of other religious groups and non-believers . 


russian finance minister alexander livshits warned financially-troubled norilsk nickel on friday that it must pay overdue taxes , but analysts said the firm would not be liquidated or that its would assets would be frozen . 


" norilsk really is a big debtor , both to the federal and regional budgets , " said konstantin chernyshev , equities analyst at moscow brokerage rinaco plus and a norilsk watcher . " 


the official itar-tass news agency quoted livshits as telling parliamentary deputies that rao norilsky nikel 0#nkel.ruo had to pay its tax arrears and that bankruptcy procedures applied to the metals group . 


" if it was an unsolicited statement and a bolt out of the blue , then it obviously means something , " said christopher granville , chief economist at united city bank in moscow . 


" but if it was a response to a deputy 's question that was essentially loaded , then it was the only answer he could have given . " 


russian tax and cabinet authorities , under pressure from the international monetary fund to boost tax revenues as a condition for receiving payments of a $ 10 billion , three-year loan to moscow , have been striking fear into the hearts of some of russia 's most prominent industrial firms by saying they must pay up or face liquidation . 


" they could freeze metal , but it 's not a long-term solution to the problem and would n't put money in the budget , " chernyshev said . " 


entire social infrastructures in the icy far north where norilsk is based depend on the company , and moscow has said it has no finances to resettle hundreds of thousands of people -- an expenditure which could far outstrip norilsk 's debts . 


analysts said the government , while anxious about norilsk 's debts , is highly unlikely to bring the nickel , copper , cobalt , platinum and platinum group metals producer to its knees or take measures that could significantly affect output . 


but it also wants norilsk , the world 's second-largest nickel producer , to clean up its act . 


he estimated the company 's regional debts at least one trillion roubles and said 30 percent of the giant krasnoyarsk regional budget was fuelled by norilsk money . 


but the changes have yet to improve significantly norilsk 's situation . 


" uneximbank has inherited a mountain and whether or not they climb out and over it remains to be seen , " said one metals source . 


the company said last month that it had worked out a tax payment schedule with authorities , after regional tax officials threatened to seize some nickel and copper assets . 


demand deposits rose to 855.8 million kroons from 834.6 million kroons and time deposits increased to 295.1 million kroons from 285.3 million kroons . 


interfax news agency quoted first deputy foreign minister igor ivanov as saying moscow was ready for " most active and constructive " work with albright . 


but he noted that policy would be shaped by clinton and president boris yeltsin . 


clinton and yeltsin are due to meet next march for their first summit since both were re-elected . 


interfax , outlining albright 's biography , pointed out that she had defended washington 's interests fiercely as u.s. ambassador to the united nations and that this had included actively supporting nato 's plans to expand eastwards . 


russia opposes nato 's plans to take in countries of eastern and central europe which used to be part of the soviet-led warsaw pact , saying such moves would threaten its security . 


he took over there , and took control of the red button controlling nuclear arms , in december 1991 when mikhail gorbachev resigned , marking the end of the soviet union . 


yeltsin has been shown a few times on television since his quintuple bypass on november 5 but has yet to deliver any major television or radio address to the nation . 


the official tasr news agency said the explosion blew out all ground floor windows of frantisek gaulieder 's family home in galanta , western slovakia , and damaged the main entrance , but no-one was injured . 


" this was an act of terrorism and now i fear not only for my own life , but also of that of my wife and children , " he told tasr . 


gaulieder 's family was sleeping in a bedroom at the back of the house and were unharmed by the blast . 


a bomb exploded on friday at a mosque in the central bulgarian town of kazanluk , causing damage but no injuries , state radio said .

mexico stocks off lows but still hit by greenspan . 


mexican stocks closed sharply lower friday , but had made a tentative recovery as initial panic and volatility abated . 


the blue-chip ipc index ended down 1.29 points , or 43.56 percent , at 3,333.05 . 


mexican stocks were also hurt by u.s. long bond rates which had begun to rise before greenspan 's comments and were inflated by employment data released before trade began in mexico . 


traders noted the lack of blue chips or stocks traded at significant volume among the gainers . 


heavyweights telmex and televisa ended off 25 cents and 75 cents , respectively , at $ 31.125 and $ 25.875 . 


traders and analysts differed as to how firm the relative recovery on friday was . 


" some buyers stepped in , but the market was not very convinced . 


ponce said shares were certainly attractively priced in mexico , but would not appreciate until foreign buyers stepped in , which they had yet to do . ' 


a controlled exchange rate , trade liberalisation and tight monetary policies have also dramatically curbed inflation , making more money available for cosmetic surgery . 


brazil has been at the forefront in plastic surgery for decades and is home to one of the most famous surgeons , ivo pitangy . 


every year , 500 new plastic surgeons graduate in brazil and medical students from all over the world come to study there . 


hakme attributes brazil 's fascination with plastic surgery not to excessive vanity but to the country 's mix and match of different races , which can create physical disharmonies . " 


what happens is the nose sometimes does n't match the mouth or the buttocks do n't match with the legs , " he said . 


stomach tucks and breast operations are also popular since the tropical climate calls for flesh-baring fashions , but unlike women elsewhere brazilians tend to have breast reductions and buttock implants . 


beauty ideals and cultures are different in every country . " 


saldanha said operations fell 30 percent immediately after that case but the rate was back to normal now .

chile and mexico will start negotiations next year to broaden their free trade agreement to include services and investments , finance minister eduardo aninat said . 


chile hopes to broaden the treaty signed in 1994 beyond reduction of tariffs on imports and exports and add provisions covering services and investment codes , said aninat . 


' ' in january or february , we 'll have some very close contacts with mexico to add the issue of services and advance on the issue of investments , ' ' aninat told reporters after signing a free trade deal with canada . 


' ' we want to give the treaty between mexico and chile greater depth and coverage than it has now . 


it 's very good now , but it practically only covers trade in goods , ' ' he said . 


' ' the reactions from business and unions which i have seen have been almost unanimously positive , so i do n't see any problem , ' ' he said . 


the indonesian government has condemned the inclusion of ramos horta in the award , and foreign minister ali alatas said on friday that indonesia would not be represented officially at the ceremony in the norwegian capital . 


belo and ramos horta were awared the prize for their efforts to secure a peaceful solution to the issue of east timor , a former portuguese colony which indonesia invaded in 1975 and annexed the following year . 


asked if the indonesian ambassador to norway would have attended the ceremony if only belo had been involved , alatas replied : " probably , yes , but that is a hypothetical question . " 


alatas said on tuesday that on his way back from oslo , belo would visit the vatican to see the pope , and would also meet german chancellor helmut kohl in bonn . 


kohl had wanted to meet belo during the chancellor 's official visit to indonesia last month , but the bishop was too busy in east timor to come to jakarta . 


china 's state council , or cabinet , has given a port in the southern province of hainan permission to open to foreign vessels , the xinhua news agency said on friday .

burmese troops and riot police moved in to disperse a student street protest at a suburban road junction near the ranyon ( rangoon ) university early on saturday , witnesses said . 


they said police and troops used water cannons from fire engines to subdue about 120 university students sitting in at the centre of the junction at about 3 a.m. before they moved in to round them up . 


the witnesses said some of the students were hit with batons while they were herded onto the vehicles and it was believed they were taken to the insein prison in suburban rangoon . 


the protesting students , mostly from rangoon university , were demanding the right to organise independent unions on campuses and the release of about 80 student leaders currently in jail . 


about 200 burmese students marched briefly from troubled yangon institute of technology in northern rangoon on friday towards the university of yangon six km ( four miles ) away , and returned to their campus , witnesses said . 


seven truckloads of armed riot police and three fire engines were on standby at one of the junctions near the institute . 


but about 300 university students were still gathered outside the gates of their campus , witnesses said . 


on monday and tuesday , students from the institute and the university launched protests against what they said was unfair handling by police of a brawl between some of their colleagues and restaurant owners in october . 


on tuesday and wednesday , opposition leader aung san suu kyi was restricted to her home by the military government to prevent her from being drawn into the protests . 


thousands were killed or imprisoned . 


they told reuters they were unhappy that the ruling state law and order restoration council ( slorc ) had not heeded their calls for the right to organise independent unions on campus . 


but the students stressed their protests were non-political and they had no contact with suu kyi 's national league for democracy ( nld ) . 


suu kyi , a nobel laureate and daughter of independence hero aung san , and key nld officials have also denied any link with the students . 


but they have said both parties had a " moral link " in that they were against police brutality and injustice . 


jordan said a small group of developing nations that oppose linking trade talks and labour conditions had pressured world trade organisation ( wto ) officials to prevent hansenne from taking the platform to urge such links . 


" it is to their shame that those who are responsible for encouraging this meeting responded ( to the pressure ) in silencing him , " jordan said after the opening of an icftu conference on international labour standards and trade . 


jordan said the wto 's credibility was at stake over the issue of trade and labour . 


the icftu said it wanted the wto conference beginning on monday to outlaw forced and child labour , end discrimination in hiring , and guarantee the right to join a union . 


bill brett , chairman of the ilo workers group , told reuters before the news conference he was " not too surprised , but very disappointed " that the speaking invitation had been withdrawn . 


" some governments are very determined to stop the issue ( of trade and labour rights ) being discussed , " he said , adding that the association of southeast asian nations ( asean ) seemed particularly hostile to the ilo agenda . 


asean groups brunei , indonesia , malaysia , the philippines , singapore , thailand and vietnam . 


the ilo wants a trade and labour rights " social clause " included in the final ministerial statement issued by wto leaders at the end of the meeting , the organization 's first ministerial-level gathering . 


but he said the wto 's organisational structure made it difficult to impose on its members a social clause such as that called for by the ilo . 


indian rubber demand is seen outpacing local production in the 1996/97 april / march season and the trend will persist way into the next century , the chairman of the rubber board of india said on friday . 


indian synthetic rubber output is not expected to rise significantly in the next season but demand will rise to 145,000 tonnes . 


matthew estimates that by the 2000/01 season , the gap between natural rubber output and consumption will rise to 51,000 tonnes and 319,000 tonnes in 2010/11 . 


one way to bridge the widening gap is to put more land under cultivation which the rubber board official estimates will reach 220,000 hectares between now and the year 2003 although matthew said this may not be possible at this time in india . 


comments by japan 's tight-lipped central bank chief and an influential top bureaucrat are further signs that the nation 's authorities want to keep the dollar at current levels , market sources said on friday . 


this followed a widely watched television appearance late on thursday by eisuke sakakibara , a high-ranking finance ministry official , who denied he had said he wants to guide the dollar lower to between 108 and 110 yen . 


but many in the market thought sakakibara 's real intentions lay elsewhere , and took more notice of his comments about the u.s. government 's stance on the dollar , dealers said . 


takao sakoh , first vice president at union bank of switzerland in tokyo , said : " maybe a dollar at 104.50 yen is not acceptable ( to sakakibara ) , but it may be okay at the current level , at the lower end of 112 yen . " 


he had said then that the market 's view on japan 's economy was too pessimistic and that he believed it was stronger than the market thought . 


" the recent level of the yen exchange rate has been stable , and it does not appear to be moving towards a further depreciation of the yen immediately , so import prices are likely to stabilise at current levels , " matsushita said in an interview with the nihon keizai shimbun . 


" the fact that he touched on the issue of inflation triggered by import prices shows that the boj does not want a further depreciation of the yen , past 115 yen , " said yasuhito kawashima , chief forex manager at toyo trust & banking co . 


" i realise there are negative views in the markets about the impact of the consumption tax hike and drop in public spending , but the markets appear to be exaggerating the magnitude of the negative impact , " a senior boj official told reuters on friday . 


lahd said a few days after the trial began on february 16 that lebanese authorities must drop the charges or risk blocking any peace deal with the jewish state . 


the charges against lahd were : forming a hostile army , carrying weapons on israel 's side , helping israel strip off a part of lebanese territory by violence , forming an armed gang , killing or trying to kill lebanese civilians by artillery shelling and kidnapping lebanese citizens for long periods . 


israel and lahd have repeatedly demanded safety guarantees for the sla -- a mixed christian-shi'ite moslem force -- which the jewish states regards as loyal allies . 


but lebanese political analysts have said that would be out of the question and lebanese authorities pre-empted the issue by taking legal action against lahd . 


peres , who was ousted in may by rightwing israeli leader benjamin netanyahu , said there could not be real negotiations with lebanon " unless it will stop the maltreatment of the sla and its commanders . " 


saqr , whose trial was concurrent with lahd 's , was convicted of " contacting the israeli enemy , passing information to israel and undertaking hostile acts against lebanon " .

" i bear witness that there is no god but allah and i bear witness that the prophet mohammed is the messenger of god , " he quoted mills as saying . 


prison officials said they had no record of mills ' official conversion , but they said that , on may 14 , 1991 , he had asked that a new name , yuhanna abdullah muhammed , be added to his prison file , which is usually an indication of a conversion to islam .

as many as 1 million dog bites are recorded in the united states every year and half of them are provoked by humans , a veterinarian told fellow animal doctors on friday .

dogs and children do n't have to have an interaction . 


cornwell said 50 percent of reported bites were provoked by a person and 60 percent were suffered by children .

the five breeds credited with the most incidents were chow chows , rottweilers , german shepherds , cocker spaniels and dalmatians . "

the united states thursday blasted the release from a greek prison of a palestinian guerrilla convicted of bombing an airliner and killing a teenager in 1982 , saying the move " does not make sense . " 


mahammad rashid was whisked from korydallos maximum security prison just outside athens to the airport where he boarded a regular olympic airways flight to cairo where he would transit to tunis and the former palestine liberation organisation headquarters .

the united states accuses rashid of belonging to the may 15 palestinian guerrilla group and being an accomplished student of master palestinian bombmaker abu ibrahim . 


three fbi agents who testified against rashid during the trial , held at korydallos prison , said they had ample evidence against rashid for a bomb planted on a pan american plane in brazil in 1982 and a mid-air bomb blast on a twa airliner approaching athens in 1986 which killed four u.s. citizens .

there is the international prestige singapore would enjoy , but " more importantly there is a genuine national interest in fostering better global free trade and an open market " , said tan kong yam , head of business policy at the national university of singapore .

supple said hosting the meeting carried prestige for singapore , " however , this is quite intangible as the prestige factor may not necessarily lead to any additional investment and trade flows to this region . " 


a large part of singapore 's workforce would be mobilised to ensure the meeting would run without a glitch but the average singaporean " would probably not be too concerned about some of the issues , " tan said . 


" but the more educated public will realise that these kind of things are important for singapore as a small economy . " 


" if there are any movements toward freer trade , then singapore 's economy and the electorate would gain , " he said . "
