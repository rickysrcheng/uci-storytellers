west indian all-rounder phil simmons took four for 38 on friday as leicestershire beat somerset by an innings and 39 runs in two days to take over at the head of the county championship . 


their stay on top , though , may be short-lived as title rivals essex , derbyshire and surrey all closed in on victory while kent made up for lost time in their rain-affected match against nottinghamshire . 


essex , however , look certain to regain their top spot after nasser hussain and peter such gave them a firm grip on their match against yorkshire at headingley . 


hussain , considered surplus to england 's one-day requirements , struck 158 , his first championship century of the season , as essex reached 372 and took a first innings lead of 82 . 


by the close yorkshire had turned that into a 37-run advantage but off-spinner such had scuttled their hopes , taking four for 24 in 48 balls and leaving them hanging on 119 for five and praying for rain . 


australian tom moody took six for 82 but chris adams , 123 , and tim o'gorman , 109 , took derbyshire to 471 and a first innings lead of 233 . 


they were held up by a gritty 84 from paul johnson but ex-england fast bowler martin mccague took four for 55 .

seven iraqis who seized a sudanese airliner with 199 people aboard and forced it to fly to london were on friday charged with hijack , ending speculation that they might be offered immediate asylum in britain . 


police said the seven men , who freed all their hostages after the plane landed at stansted airport on tuesday and then appealed for asylum , would appear in court on saturday . 


the iraqis claimed they were " ordinary people persecuted by the regime of saddam ( hussein ) " but interior ministry officials had consistently said it was likely the seven would be charged with hijack before any plea for asylum was considered . 


under english law the maximum sentence for hijack is life imprisonment , but there has been widespread speculation that the seven will receive lesser sentences and then be allowed to stay rather than being sent back to iraq . 


after a search of the aircraft following the hijackers ' surrender , police found only knives and fake explosives .

tajik government troops now control of the strategically vital town of tavildara after driving out islamic rebels , but sporadic gunfire still echoed in the nearby pamir mountains on friday . 


the commander-in-chief of tajikistan 's armed forces , major-general nikolai sherbatov , took a group of journalists by helicopter to the remote , and now devastated , town to show that his forces held it .

president clinton , bob dole and ross perot are hitting the road now that the partying is over , and people who have billions of dollars invested in stocks were bracing for political promises that could have an impact on their wealth . 


" the worst thing that could happen for financial markets is that if clinton and dole start to trade shots in the middle of the ring with one-upmanship , " said hugh johnson , chief investment officer at first albany corp. " that 's when wall street will need to worry . " 


he said that the bond market would be the first to react if the " bidding " intensifies and stocks would quickly drop as interest rates rise . 


clinton proposes an $ 8.4 billion re-election agenda that would spare most home-sellers from capital gains taxes and give employers tax incentives to hire people off the welfare rolls . 


" the stock market will have to edit the promises and then do a probability study on those edited promises , " said john geraghty at the consulting firm north american equity services . 


george bush became president in 1988 on his no-new-tax campaign and clinton won in 1992 with a promise to fatten workers ' paychecks .

" stocks are on a delicate edge because if something happens that looks like it could upset the presidency , it could throw the political and , to some extent the economic , process into chaos , " geraghty said . 


" we have an election where there are so many unknown variables that most people will probably want to hold fire , and even take the chance that they will have to pay higher prices for stocks after the november election , than take the risk that a shock to the system will hurt the stock market , " geraghty said . 


the standard & poor 's index of 500 stocks was off 5.41 points at 651.99 , down 15.03 points for the week .

factory orders rose in july and manufacturing surged in the midwest in august , reports said friday , sparking worries about inflation that battered financial markets for a second straight day . 


while production and orders rose at midwest area businesses , the prices they paid for goods used in manufacturing remained well in check . 


analysts said the reports implied the economy was not slowing down in the third quarter after a burst of growth in the spring , and that the lull in late june and july was more temporary than federal reserve policy-makers had wanted . 


" it appears that august is showing an economy again reversing course and is not moving onto a significantly slower track at this point , " said economist lynn reaser of barnett banks inc. in jacksonville , fla . 


the reports fanned worries on wall street that the fed , the nation 's central bank , would raise rates next month in a bid to ward off inflation , driving stock and bond prices sharply lower for a second day running . 


a third report from the commerce department , on july personal income and spending , pointed to a potential slowdown in consumer spending that some analysts said may help moderate growth in the second half . 


incomes from wages , salaries and all other sources gained 0.1 percent to a rate of $ 6.47 trillion after a 0.9 percent jump in june .

it already has adopted a bias toward raising rates to keep a lid on wage and price rises and help sustain the 5-1 / 2-year-old economic expansion . 


he added that with expansion as solid as it is and with unemployment so low " the greater risks are clearly that we might see some overheating . " 


" the economy is not going to be expanding at the 4.8 percent ( annual ) rate that we had in the second quarter but it is likely to keep expanding in the 3 percent range , " she said , above the 2 percent to 2-1/4 percent that the fed considers to be non-inflationary .

" we could lift the ban tomorrow , but that would not mean anything immediately , " said drazek . " 


under the administration 's proposal , the borders to the mexican produce would be opened into 19 northern and northeastern states from november through february . 


mexican officials contend that there is no scientific basis for the ban , and that it is illegal under international trading rules of the world trade organisation . 


proponents of the plan discount the worries of the u.s. growers and say the plan has enough safeguards built into it to eliminate any significant threat to american producers . 


mexican growers and distributors would have to abide by strict rules established by the mexican and u.s. agriculture agencies . 


the california avocado commission -- which has spearheaded the opposition to lifting the ban -- said new data the group submitted to the agriculture department last spring shows the department underestimated the pest problem in mexico and have urged that the agency reopen its study of the issue . 


the administration is still studying the new data , and officials have said that if experts think the information is significant , the agency could reopen its investigation . 


but u.s. avocado industry sources said that while they may have delayed the plan for a while , they ultimately do not expect the administration to change its position . 


" from a common-sense view , the department should reconsider this plan , but due to politics they will probably go ahead with this , " said tom bellamore of the california avocado group .

chicago cardinal joseph bernardin , head of the second-largest u.s. roman catholic archdiocese , said on friday his doctors had diagnosed him as having liver cancer and he had a year or less to live . 


bernardin , 68 , underwent extensive surgery for pancreatic cancer in june 1995 followed by months of chemotherapy , which he said made him more aware of his own vulnerabilities and the need to minister to the sick . 


i am told that it is terminal and that my life expectancy is one year or less , " a composed bernardin told a news conference . 


in 14 years as chicago 's archbishop , he built a prayerful , saintly image and was deeply involved in world church issues and publicly committed to rooting out abuses by clergy . 


" i have been assured that i still have some quality time left , " he said , saying he would undergo a new form of chemotherapy but his doctors have told him there was only a slim chance of a cure and the liver cancer was inoperable . 


death does have some sad dimensions to it but i am a man of faith , " he said . " 


surgeons removed a cancerous kidney , parts of his pancreas and stomach , small intestine , bile duct and surrounding tissues . 


he made a rapid recovery and resumed most of his duties , but then developed a deteriorating condition in his spine that caused him great pain and shortened his height by several inches . 


he was scheduled to undergo back surgery next month , but that was cancelled when the cancer was discovered in his liver in order to avoid delaying the start of chemotherapy . 


bernardin steadfastly denied the charges and the former student later recanted his tale of abuse . 


bernardin , who became archbishop of cincinnati in 1972 , played an increasingly prominent role in the u.s. church as a moderate voice of compromise among liberals and conservatives in the ranks of the bishops . 


previously , he was instrumental in drafting church policy on war , peace and nuclear arms , and for seven years he headed the bishops ' anti-abortion policy committee , espousing a policy describing human life as a " seamless garment . "

" boatmen 's was the plum of missouri and was the plum of the central midwest , " weber said . 


but nationsbank 's bid , representing a premium of 40 percent for boatmen 's stock , was large enough to get the deal done . 


" i think boatmen 's was shopping itself , and everybody knew if you wanted to be the winning buyer here , you had to make the bid nobody would beat , " ancell said . 


but some analysts cautioned that other targets should not expect as large a premium . 


" i think initially some stocks will trade up on sympathy , but the wild premium nationsbank put on this deal here , i do n't see a lot of other deals being done at this premium , " said michael durante , analyst at mcdonald & co .

incomes from wages , salaries and all other sources gained 0.1 percent to a rate of $ 6.47 trillion after a 0.9 percent jump in june . 


wages and salaries came under pressure in july as a shorter average workweek and lower hourly earnings cut into paychecks . 


the department said wages and salaries decreased by $ 6.9 billion in july after climbing $ 45 billion in june . 


" in july , average weekly hours and average hourly earnings declined , more than offsetting the effect of an increase in employment , " commerce said . 


but more money went into savings accounts , as savings held at 5.3 cents out of each dollar earned in both june and july . 


the generally lackluster report on spending and incomes in july had been expected . 


commerce said previously that spending at retail stores was up only 0.1 percent in july , partly because of softer sales of new cars and light trucks . 


it showed average hourly earnings fell in july by 0.2 percent to $ 11.00 and the average workweek shortened to 34.3 hours from 34.7 in june . 


gains in personal income , which includes wages and salaries as well as income from sources such as dividends , interest and businesses , are essential for funding consumer purchases , which fuel two-thirds of national economic activity .

italian tyre and cables giant pirelli on friday announced its long-awaited move into china with a cables joint venture set to capitalise on the rapidly-growing chinese telecommunications market . 


the partners will invest around $ 30 million in the existing copper cable plant at wuxi to update technology and include optic fibre production , with annual turnover expected to reach $ 60 million within the next few years . 


the move marks a further move by pirelli 's cables division to expand in the fast-growing far eastern developing markets with the group already present in indonesia , india and malaysia . 


" this is really positive news for pirelli , and i expect that it will produce one of the best half-year results in late september compared to other industrial italian companies , " said analyst paula buratti at indosuez . 


she emphasised that the move was positive because pirelli will have management control of the chinese venture , and it also showed another example of pirelli exporting its technical know-how to developing markets . 


pirelli shares reacted favourable even though talks had been underway for some time and news about a venture had been widely expected . 


this will be pirelli 's first industrial involvement in a chinese market where demand for telecommunication networks is expected to grow to 80-100 million new lines between 1996 and 2000 , doubling demand for optical cables . 


china 's second largest telecoms operator unicom already has a mandate from the central government to establish 15 million new phone lines by the year 2000 , which will necessitate new trunk line systems and local distribution networks . 


" the starting of this production base in china has for our group an undoubted strategic value , representing an important enhancement of our presence in asia , " said pirelli spa chairman and chief executive officer marco tonchetti provera . 


pirelli cables has global sales of over $ 3.5 billion , and has become a large supplier of optic cables and systems to major telecoms carriers in the u.s. , europe and the far east .

russian peacemaker alexander lebed and chechen separatist military leader aslan maskhadov started a new round of peace talks on friday just outside the rebel region . 


cotti said chechnya must remain part of russia , but the solution to the conflict would be to accord the region maximum autonomy within russia 's borders . 


" there is no doubt that chechnya , according to osce principles , belongs to a state called russia , " he said , pointing out that russia was an osce member and it was not the organisation 's policy to challenge members ' sovereignty . 


he added that the osce was the only international body which has been allowed into the chechnya to monitor the human rights situation there , but that its means were restricted by the fact that the conflict was a " internal issue " .

mehrtens missed three further penalties and a conversion in the first 40 minutes which could have put his side ahead , but it was the springboks who looked the more dangerous . 


their promise was realised when joubert made a 40-metre break in the 25th minute and , although winger pieter hendriks appeared to knock on joubert 's reverse pass , welsh referee derek bevan allowed van der westhuizen to pick up and score under the posts . 


honiball converted and joubert kicked a penalty before all black hooker sean fitzpatrick scored a try from close range on the stroke of half-time to narrow the lead to 16-8 and hint at a comeback . 


instead joubert kicked another long penalty and then raced around the outside of the defence to score the springboks ' second try . 


a quick penalty from van der westhuizen five metres from the all black line set up the third try for venter five minutes later and when joubert kicked his third penalty the springboks held an unassailable 32-8 lead going into the last quarter . 


centre walter little followed up mehrtens ' kick to score under the posts and scrum-half justin marshall forced himself over from a ruck close to the line in injury-time to give them some consolation .

armenia and portugal drew 0-0 in a world cup soccer european group 9 qualifier on saturday . 


when the referee called jansher 's return good and the decision was accepted by the player , hill shrieked at the pakistani : " you cheat . "

hill won the game on the next point and said later that jansher was generally honest on court but played by the referee 's decision . 


the australian had upset jansher 's rhythm with his mixture of gamesmanship and fluent stroke-making but eventually succumbed 15-7 17-15 14-15 15-8 . 


" i changed my strategy against him today and had him rattled , " he added . 


he is not as fit as he used to be be but was too good for me in the end . 


i shook him a bit but he will come out next time and be a better player for it -- that 's jansher . " 


what he did was bad for squash , bad for the crowd and bad for the sponsors . 


" we are trying to build up squash like tennis and players should not say things like that . 


" i think the professional squash association should look into this matter and deal with it properly . 


i am not calling for him to be banned but they have to take some action . " 


" i have nothing against jansher but it will be great if i could beat him , " said eyles . "

seles easily won both her singles matches and king is counting on the co-world number one to lead the team again . 


seles 's sore left shoulder and a wrist injury to fed cup veteran mary joe fernandez have forced king to take a wait and see attitude regarding her squad for the best-of-five match . 


" we will wait until the last minute so we check with everybody and their injuries , " said king . " 


what we like would be seles , ( olympic champion lindsay ) davenport and mary joe fernandez . "

austria dominated their world cup group four qualifier against scotland on saturday with wave after wave of attacks but were unable to penetrate the visitors ' defence and had to settle for a goalless draw .

but they were almost upset 12 minutes from time when de wilde fumbled a hard arif erdem shot and orhan cikirikci almost pounced on the loose ball .

we really want the war to end , we hope and believe that our sons and brothers will win , " said dudayeva , adding that she was from urus-martan . 


urus-martan is a traditionally anti-separatist pocket in chechnya and moscow-backed leader doku zavgayev , who has been sidelined in the peace deal , has warned that it and places like it could become centres of civil war if russian troops leave .

xiao qiang , executive director of the new york-based group human rights in china , said wang 's arrest on friday appeared to be part of the national " strike hard " campaign that has imprisoned thousands and sent hundreds to their death . 


the authorities are apparently extremely afraid of any political and social discontent , " said xiao , in manila to attend an amnesty international conference on human rights in china . 


he said one of wang 's apparent offences was to write a public letter in may suggesting that a free press and an independent judicial system were vital if the government really meant to stamp out rampant corruption .

you only make things more hidden but potentially more explosive , " he said .

burma 's democracy leader aung san suu kyi hit out at the government on saturday for recent arrests and jailing of activists , saying the military abused the law to try to crush the democracy movement . 


suu kyi said at least 61 democracy supporters had been arrested since may , and about 30 of them had been sentenced , most to long prison terms . 


most were released but several dozen remain in custody . 


the military government , which in may said it had detained the politicians to prevent anarchy , said the activists were charged with attempting to destroy the peace and stability of the state . 


but suu kyi disagreed with the methods , saying officials often arrested nld supporters in the middle of the night , then did not give them the opportunity to defend themselves in trials . 


the nld party won a landslide victory in a 1990 election but the state law and order restoration council ( slorc ) , which assumed power in 1988 after crushing pro-democracy demonstrations , never recognised the poll . 


they are using a travesty of the law to try and crush our movements and to sentence our people to long terms in prison without proper trial . " 


suu kyi said once the activists were sentenced , they suffered inhuman conditions and lack of rights in prison . 


some who have been released have recounted torture methods like sleep and food deprivation and physical abuse . 


his death came five weeks after james leander ( leo ) nichols , a close friend of suu kyi and danish honorary consul , died while serving a prison term at insein . 


but she said she and the nld would not stop their efforts to bring democracy to burma even if it meant more arrests of party members or even herself .
